Preface to the Project Gutenberg Edition
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Nearly three decades have passed since <i>When You Don't Know Where to
Turn</i> was first published. In that time, psychiatry, clinical psychology,
and counseling have changed a good deal.
</p>

<p>
Psychiatry has continued on a now well-worn path leading to a more and
more inflated universe of diagnostic labels, the majority of which have
no known organic basis. Few readers who are not themselves mental health
professionals realize that these diagnostic classifications are <i>voted
into existence</i> by committees of psychiatrists whose pronouncements
magically summon into being a lengthening list of so-called "mental
disorders." These pronouncements are then applied to people in order
to label their problems (as well as the people who have them), to match
their problems with allegedly effective treatments, and in the process
to give the impression that a respectable medical process of diagnosis
and intervention has been undertaken.
</p>

<p>
And yet these so-called "mental disorders" do little more than equate
designated patterns of behavior, emotion, or thought&mdash;called syndromes&mdash;with
alleged psychological malfunctioning. Such syndromes are no more than
sets of symptoms that can be collected together in a wide variety of
different ways, but depending upon how they are grouped, distinguishable
syndromes can be pointed to and named. This is a highly arbitrary process
very much like fortune-telling using tea leaves, which depends on the
pattern seen or imagined in the tea leaves at the bottom of a cup.
</p>

<p>
During the past three decades, clinical psychology and its less formal
cousin, counseling, have also undergone noticeable change. They have
been the traditional sources of a large number of diverse approaches
to psychotherapy and counseling. But in the past thirty years, the
large number of approaches to psychotherapy and counseling has, in
practical reality, shrunk considerably. This has been due to the rapid
dominance and virtual monopoly that has been gained by cognitive-behavioral
therapy, also known as rational-emotive therapy. Insurance companies
have been attracted like flies to the sweetness of the comparatively
brief treatment period touted by cognitive-behavioral therapy, and
practitioners have similarly been attracted by the ease of using its
one-size-fits-all approach.
</p>

<p>
And so where the changes in psychiatry have been inflationary in
its authorized catalogue of "mental disorders" known as the <i>DSM</i>
(<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>), clinical
psychology and counseling have been on a deflationary course that
has progressively narrowed the treatment options available to many
people.
</p>

<p>
Despite the passage of time, <i>When You Don't Know Where to Turn</i>
remains the only step-by-step self-diagnosing guide to counseling
and therapy, a guide that seeks to direct individuals&mdash;by respecting
and responding to the very great differences that exist among
individuals&mdash;to approaches to counseling and therapy that may be most
likely to benefit them&mdash;taking into account the nature of their own
individual problems, their different degrees of willingness and
abilities to learn and to change, and their differing individual
situations in life, including their financial resources and the
amount of time that they are willing to devote to therapy.
</p>

<p>
Such a customized, individually-centered perspective is not popular
today. The human population continues inexorably to expand while our
healthcare system insists on general applicability and streamlined
efficiency. Individual problems in living are more easily and rapidly
"processed" when they can be subsumed under specifiable diagnostic
and treatment codes. In this increasingly mechanized process, the
individual person and the individual problems of living he or she is
attempting to cope with tend more and more to be ignored or neglected,
and his or her diagnosable "disease entity" becomes the object of
attention.
</p>

<p>
These comments are not a polemic against current trends and fashions;
they are rather intended to place in perspective the changes that have
occurred in the mental health field during the past three decades
since the first edition of this book came off the press. What a reader
might take away from these preliminary remarks are these suggestions:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to recognize that, like so much that is a human production, today's
classification system of mental disorders is unlikely to be the final
word about the human condition, but that its proliferating list of
mental disorders should be taken by the humble at least with a grain
of salt, and rejected wholesale by those who are more critically inclined;
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to accept the fact that it is becoming harder with the passage of
time to find one's way to a mental health clinician who is <i>not</i>
recipe-oriented, due to the in-fashion monopoly that prescribes
cognitive-behavioral therapy, and due to the pressures on the healthcare
system to process people and their problems faster and at lower
cost; and, finally,
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to realize that, when it comes to problems of living, those who are
willing to accept a healthy measure of responsibility for their own
choice of practitioner and treatment are most likely to find a
practitioner and a treatment that meet their individual needs.
</p>

<p>
From this point of view, <i>When You Don't Know Where to Turn</i> continues
to offer readers a heightened consciousness of alternatives to treatment
that do still continue to available, though they can be somewhat harder
to find in some areas of the country, and to give readers a sense of
what those alternatives have to offer and for which kinds of problems
and personalities they may best be suited.

BEFORE WE BEGIN ...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="bullet">
* A recent study by the National Institute of Mental Health
shows that one American in five suffers from some type of
psychiatric disorder: 50.5 million Americans have one or
another of eight serious psychiatric disorders, ranging
from anxiety disorders and phobias to depression and
schizophrenia.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Of these, only one person in five seeks professional help.
More than 40,400,000 severely troubled people do not
receive any treatment.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* An unknown number of healthy, emotionally untroubled
Americans enter therapy for reasons of self-development.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* More than 130 distinguishable therapies now exist.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* These therapies are offered by a variety of health care
professionals, including social work counselors, clinical
and counseling psychologists, psychiatrists, biofeedback
therapists, and others.  Their backgrounds, training, fees,
and durations of treatment vary considerably.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* These professionals practice in a number of different
settings: in private practice, group sessions, public and
private agencies, hospitals, newly established nonhospital
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
inpatient facilities, and in the context of educational
programs.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Most people who enter therapy do not know what
alternative approaches to therapy exist or how to choose
among them.  They usually locate a therapist in a more or
less random way.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Most people fear the idea of entering counseling or
psychotherapy.  They do not have a clear conception of
what to expect: they do not know in advance what the
<i>experience</i> of therapy is like.
</p>

* For a variety of reasons, many people who think of going
to a therapist are concerned about whether their
relationship with the therapist will really be confidential.
If you are especially concerned about privacy, you should
be aware of several ways that confidentiality may be
broken, what the laws concerning confidentiality are, and,
in particular (what few people realize), how insurance
claims for psychological care can invade an individual's
privacy.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Counselors and therapists tend to specialize in one or a
small number of alternative approaches to therapy.  Some
approaches to therapy are most appropriate for treating
certain problems or responding to certain personal
interests; others are better suited to providing help with
other problems and concerns.  Choosing a therapist with an
orientation that is right for <i>you</i> can be extremely helpful
and can help you save much time, money, and energy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These facts highlight the situation in counseling and
psychotherapy that anyone faces who enters therapy today.
</p>

<p>
From them, you can see that there is a bewildering array of
counseling professions, of distinct approaches to therapy, and of
settings in which help is offered.  This guide's intention and hope
is to help you understand the alternatives, and to help you form
your own judgment how it may be best to proceed.
</p>

<p>
The book hopes to give you real assistance so you may make a
good choice&mdash;thereby saving you emotional investment, time,
money, and the potential discouragement of avoidable false
starts with therapies that may not help because they are not
relevant to your goals, values, and personality.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
</p>

<p>
I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. William Altus, then
Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, who went out of his way to encourage my first interests
in psychotherapy when I was a graduate student there twenty
years ago.  To Professor Paul Ricoeur, I would like to express my
admiration for his original contributions to Freud scholarship
and my enduring gratitude for his willingness to direct my
doctoral research at the UniversitÃ© de Paris.
</p>

<p>
I am indebted to Dr. Raphael Becvar, Professor, Marriage and
Family Therapy, Saint Louis University, both for making it
possible for a faculty colleague to learn from him in several of his
excellent seminars and for his later comradeship.  To my good
friend, Dr. Thomas Maloney, clinical psychologist in Clayton,
Missouri, I want to extend my warmest appreciation for his
personal guidance and voluntary supervision of my first efforts
in counseling.  If ever the qualities of compassion, depth of
understanding, humor, and genuine care are to be found in one
person, they are in him.  I would also like to thank Professor
Lillian Weger, George Warren Brown School of Social Work,
Washington University, St. Louis, for generously welcoming me
into her fine seminar in psychodynamic models.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I especially thank Dr. Renate Tesch and Professor Hallock
Hoffman, of the Psychology Faculty of the Fielding Institute in
Santa Barbara, for making possible a writer's retreat in the
California desert: the loan of their home in Sky Valley made
writing the last group of chapters a special and memorable
pleasure.  One is fortunate to have such friends.
</p>

<p>
If this book became more readable after its first draft, it was
due in great part to the conscientious energy of my wife, Karen,
in spotting the weeds of obfuscation that seem to grow
effortlessly in an academic's garden.  I want to thank her for her
patience, with both me and the book.
</p>

<p>
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Miss Libby
McGreevy, Assistant Editor, Contemporary Books, Inc., for her
helpful suggestions and for her regular doses of encouragement
that made writing this book a happy experience.

<i>When You<br />
  Don't Know<br />
  Where<br />
  To Turn</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t2b">
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK
</p>

<p>
I would like to introduce this book by telling you what happened
to a real and likable person who ran into some very difficult
times and as a result entered therapy.
</p>

<p>
Frank is a large man, a former college football player,
powerfully built.  He has always prided himself on his strength and
determination.  He used to be friendly and outgoing.  He had a
pleasant smile, complemented by his clear blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
Frank had worked for eleven years for a manufacturer of tools.
Not long ago, he was promoted to the position of managing the
company's sales division in a large midwestern city.  Soon after
Frank and his wife moved, his wife became pregnant with their
third child.  Frank had a well-paying job, excellent benefits, a
pleasant home they had just bought, and a contented relationship
with his wife.  But in spite of these things, he became
severely depressed.  And he began to feel terribly frightened: he
had to leave his desk several times each morning and again in the
afternoon.  He would go to the men's room, lock the door, turn on
the water faucets, and cry.
</p>

<p>
Frank lost fifteen pounds in three months.  He had a poor
appetite, slept badly, and was very anxious around his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
co-workers.  He couldn't understand what had happened to him, and
he was unwilling to let others know how unhappy he felt.  He was
ashamed of what he took to be a weakness in himself: like many
men, he was raised to believe that men shouldn't cry, and his
crying bouts shook his sense of identity and stability.  His
marriage began to suffer.  Frank and his wife seldom made love.
Frank was irritable and impatient with his wife and his children.
Frank's wife knew he was very troubled, but he refused to talk to
her about it.
</p>

<p>
For several months, Frank fought against his depression.  (If
only he had been aware of the <i>strength</i> that he mustered to do
this!)  Then he reached a crisis and could not force himself to go
to work.  He stayed home with a bad cold, slept as much as he
could, and was very short-tempered.  He was crying a good deal.
Frank's wife persuaded him to see a doctor.  The doctor
referred him to a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist saw Frank twice
a week for two-and-a-half months, but Frank was troubled by
side effects from the antidepressant medication he took under
the psychiatrist's supervision.  He resisted the idea of "taking
drugs," so he decided to see a psychotherapist who, in cooperation
with the psychiatrist, monitored Frank's condition as he
gradually went off the antidepressants.
</p>

<p>
However, after five months, Frank did not feel he was making
any real progress.  He changed to another therapist who, his wife
had heard, specialized in the treatment of depression.
</p>

<p>
Together, Frank and his new therapist came, over a period of
months, to recognize that Frank's depression had resulted from
two conflicts: Frank had hated his job but had refused to admit
this to himself, and now his wife was pregnant again, and
because of this added financial responsibility he felt forced to
stay with his present job, where he had seniority, good salary,
and benefits.
</p>

<p>
Once the basis for his depression was made clear, it was
possible to begin to treat Frank's problem.  His wife was very
willing to encourage him to plan for a change of jobs, even
though this would mean a temporary reduction in his income.
Frank saw a vocational therapist and received guidance that led
him to take some evening classes and then to become a
computer programmer for a rapidly growing local company.  His
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
depression faded away, and he now seems genuinely to be
content.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THIS BOOK
</p>

<p>
I knew Frank personally, as his therapist in a group.  (His name,
like all others in this book, has been changed, along with certain
details about his situation.)  With professional help, Frank was
able to improve his life&mdash;his sense of self-esteem, his marriage,
and his family life.  It was a long and painful process, as much
self-change can be.  But perhaps Frank's experience might have been
<i>less</i> painful, perhaps Frank might have felt less devastating
isolation, and perhaps his path to a resolution of his difficulties
could have been shortened if a practical guide to counseling and
therapy had been available to him when he first decided to find
help.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
MAKING INTELLIGENT CHOICES
</p>

<p>
This book is about how you can get the most appropriate kind
of help for your problems, goals, and personality.  Specifically,
<i>When You Don't Know Where to Turn</i> sets out to help you
become adequately informed about the range of therapists and
therapies&mdash;<i>as these relate to your own assessment of your goals
and interests</i>&mdash;so that you will be able to make intelligent
decisions about these issues:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* the <i>kind of professional</i> to seek out
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* the <i>type of therapy</i> most likely to help you with a certain
complaint or set of interests and values
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* how to locate the form of therapy that seems most
promising to you at <i>a price you can afford</i> and with <i>an
expected duration</i> you can live with
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* what <i>setting</i> to look for in which the help you would like
is offered
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This book uses two approaches, both presented here for the
first time and both based on common sense and intelligent
advance planning.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
</p>

<p>
First, you will be able, through a series of carefully organized
questions and easily followed instructions in Part I, to pinpoint
one or more approaches to therapy that may be most promising
given your initial objectives, problems, or interests.  For the first
time, a <i>self-diagnosing map</i> to the major approaches to therapy
is made available.
</p>

<p>
Second, you will have the opportunity to glimpse what typically
happens during the sessions of counselors, psychologists,
and psychiatrists as they treat clients or patients using the
different main approaches to therapy.  You will come to see what
the <i>experience</i> of therapy is like in these different approaches.
</p>

<p>
In other words, the self-diagnosing map will point you in the
direction of one, and sometimes more than one, approach to
therapy that may be most promising for you to begin the process
of self-change, and you will then be able to gain an insider's
perspective on that approach so that you can judge how well
suited to you the approach is and how it compares to the other
main approaches to therapy.
</p>

<p>
If this guide helps you choose a path to the kind of therapy that
will be appropriate and useful to you, it will have done
something worthwhile. A guide to counseling and psychotherapy
should, however, do more than this.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
OVERCOMING ISOLATION AND GETTING STARTED
</p>

<p>
People who are troubled tend to try to hide it. They frequently
isolate themselves when they are distressed, so overcoming the
desire to withdraw is the first order of business if they are to
improve their lives and feelings.
</p>

<p>
One of the things this book sets out to do is to help you see
that very likely the problems you are facing are not one of a kind.
You have a lot of company; the difficulties you are having are
probably very familiar to counselors and therapists.  Realize that
there are ways of resolving most problems and that doing so
often is easier with the sympathy, empathy, moral support,
friendship, or direction of a counselor or therapist than by
yourself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
CAN YOU HELP YOURSELF?
</p>

<p>
However, sometimes it <i>is</i> possible to help yourself a great deal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
through your own initiative.  This book will describe ways that
you can be your own source of help and will pay particular
attention to <i>when</i> it may be appropriate and safe to rely upon
inner resources.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
CLEARING THE CONFUSING JUNGLE
</p>

<p>
Most people are not familiar with the differences among the
main kinds of "psychosocial" helping professionals&mdash;the various
types of counselors, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists,
psychotherapists, psychoanalysts, social workers, etc.  Another purpose
of this book is to clarify these labels, to describe how the
approaches used by their practitioners are distinct and how they
are similar, and to give an idea of how their fees and durations of
treatment vary.
</p>

<p>
Individual chapters in Part II are devoted to describing the
main varieties of therapy available today: psychoanalysis;
psychotherapies; behavior-changing therapies; marriage and family
therapy; group therapies; exercise, biofeedback, relaxation,
hypnosis, and meditation; and drug therapy.  Each approach will be
described in the context of experiencing professional help <i>and</i>
in terms of how and when it may be possible to apply the
approach on your own.  These chapters will help you understand
what in general to expect if you choose a particular kind of
treatment, how the course of treatment may go, and what point
of view is shared by professionals who use it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
FINDING SOMEONE TO HELP
</p>

<p>
Part III of this book will describe how you can go about
locating good professional care, whether from a family therapist,
an analyst, a social worker, a psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist,
or another kind of therapist. You will learn how you can find a
reputable professional with a particular specialization, and you
will be encouraged to ask him or her some useful questions
before beginning treatment.
</p>

<p>
As we will see in detail later on, there are numerous settings in
which counselors and therapists work.  Many are in private
practice, but many also work for a variety of agencies, both
public and private, for hospitals and newly established nonhospital
residential facilities, and even for educational institutions. We
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
will discuss each of these settings in Part III so that you will have
a clear idea both of the alternatives that exist and of important
factors to consider when deciding among them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SHOULD YOU BE HOSPITALIZED?
</p>

<p>
"Should I consent to hospitalization?"  "What will I encounter
if I accept hospitalization?"  "Is it necessary, is it desirable?"
Another chapter in Part III is devoted to answering these and
related questions.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IS YOUR PRIVACY PROTECTED?
</p>

<p>
In many ways it will be, and in other ways it may not be.
Confidentiality as it relates to the treatment of emotional or
psychological difficulties is a thorny issue, one that worries
many people.  In Part III, a chapter is devoted to a discussion of
this potentially important area of personal concern.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
DOES THERAPY WORK?
</p>

<p>
You may, of course, feel a certain amount of skepticism about
the real utility and effectiveness of any one of the many therapies
that now exist.  This is, in my judgment, a healthy skepticism.  A
chapter in Part III will review what you may be able to expect,
and perhaps should not expect, in the light of recent evaluations
of the effectiveness of the main therapies.  To complement these
as yet incomplete scientific findings, I will emphasize a measure
of ordinary common sense as we go along.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
LIFE AFTER THERAPY
</p>

<p>
The last chapter in this book deals with what to expect <i>after</i>
therapy.  Recurrences, future crises&mdash;they often come with the
package: life!  Relapses&mdash;re-experiencing feelings of distress&mdash;have
received too little attention.  Often, old habits and feelings
remain with us and reappear during times of stress.  Too, we
know that as life goes on, we need to be able to tackle new
problems and new situations and sometimes must handle
unexpected crises.  Chapter 21 tells you how the experience of
therapy will help you cope with possible setbacks and the
uncertainties of the future.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When people are in pain and most need others, many wall
themselves in.  This very human tendency is illustrated by a
famous story.
</p>

<p>
In 1934, Admiral Richard Byrd led an expedition to Antarctica,
where he established a base on the edge of the Ross Ice Barrier,
700 miles north of the South Pole.  Byrd then decided to set up a
small weather observation post closer to the pole, which he
chose to man alone.  He would stay in a one-room cabin, a box
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
that measured nine feet by thirteen feet, lowered into a
rectangular hole cut into the ice to protect the cabin from gale-force
winds during the coming winter months.
</p>

<p>
Byrd was committing himself to a degree of personal isolation
few men have ever taken on.  What happened to him in the
months ahead reveals something important to psychologists that
all of us should bear in mind.
</p>

<p>
Byrd's men left him in his tiny station and returned across the
ice to the main base 123 miles to the north.  Winter blizzard
conditions soon surrounded Byrd.  He knew he was in for a long
period of solitary confinement, with no hope of returning to the
base, even if a medical emergency demanded this.  He could
never make the return trip to the base on his own, and it would
be too dangerous for a team of men to try to get to him in the
winter darkness across the miles of ice.
</p>

<p>
After several months of isolation, Byrd became very ill.  He was
distressed and confused about his condition&mdash;nausea, vomiting,
terrible headaches, blurred vision, great weakness.  Days would
go by, and he would cling to life by a thread, his mind wandering,
drifting in and out of the dizzying incoherence of frequent
comas.  He would, by sheer force of will, gather his reserve of
fading energy and stagger across the tiny room to light the stove
and open a can of food, which he soon lost from his stomach.
Gradually, he came to realize that the fumes from his kerosene
stove and from the gasoline-powered generator for the telegraph
were poisoning him.  But if he turned off the stove, he would
freeze to death, and the telegraph was his only contact with
others.
</p>

<p>
He knew his life was in real danger, yet he refused to let his
men know of his desperate situation.  Nor could he <i>admit</i> to
<i>himself</i> that he was in trouble.
</p>

<p>
Listen to his own words, written half a century ago, in his
snow-buried room with the air heavy with fumes and the inside
walls encrusted with glistening ice:
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is painful for me to dwell on the details of my collapse....
The subject is one that does not easily bear discussion, if only
because a man's hurt, like his love, is most seemly when
concealed.  From my youth I have believed that sickness was
somehow humiliating, something to be kept hidden....
</p>

<p class="quote">
To some men sickness brings a desire to be left alone; animal-like,
their instinct is to crawl into a hole and lick the hurt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
There were aspects of this situation which I would rather not
mention at all, since they involve that queer business called
self-respect....
</p>

<p class="quote">
For a reason I can't wholly explain, except in terms of pride,
I concealed from [my] men, as best I could, the true extent of
my weakness.  I never mentioned and, therefore, never
acknowledged it....  I wanted no one to be able to look over
the wall....[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]

G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1938), pp. 166, viii, 294-295.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In spite of his efforts to keep his condition to himself, Byrd's
radio operator at the main base seems to have intuited that Byrd
was in danger.  A rescue party was sent as the winter weather
became less harsh, and Byrd was brought back to the base,
probably just in time, before the fumes killed or permanently
injured him.
</p>

<p>
In many ways, Byrd's Antarctic experience parallels that of
many of us who, because of our own pain and hardship, isolate
ourselves from others.  Our lives become cold, desolate, despairing.
Our suffering is real, but for one reason or another we
cannot or will not reach out to others.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WALLING YOURSELF OFF FROM OTHERS
</p>

<p>
Most of us are aware of a need for human company and
companionship.  But when we are in pain or are severely
troubled, we often forget what has been recognized for a long
time:
</p>

<p>
Frederick II, the thirteenth-century ruler of Sicily, believed
that all children were born with a knowledge of an ancient
language.  When they were taught the language of their parents,
however, he theorized, their knowledge of the older language was
overridden and blotted out.  King Frederick hypothesized that if
children were raised without being taught a language, they
would, in time, spontaneously begin to speak in some ancient
tongue.
</p>

<p>
He therefore appointed a group of foster mothers, had new-born
infants taken from their natural mothers, and ordered the
foster mothers to raise the children in silence.
</p>

<p>
The upshot of this early experiment&mdash;as the legend goes&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
that Frederick never found out whether his theory was true.  All
of the babies died.  They could not live without affection,
touching, and loving words.  Apparently, the foster mothers withdrew
all human warmth when they sought to obey the king's order.
</p>

<p>
Today, we are aware of a baby's vital need for affection, for
human contact&mdash;and even so, in our adult lives, when human
contact is equally essential, we sometimes cut ourselves off from
others.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE MYTH OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY
</p>

<p>
As adults, we tend to emphasize self-control.  We think of
ourselves as <i>responsible</i>&mdash;to ourselves, our parents, our employers,
our children.  All this responsibility can sometimes be a
heavy load!  During periods of illness or emotional crisis, the
emphasis on <i>control</i> can be excessive.  It can create the bars of a
prison, a grillwork of defenses that stands between us and others
who are able to offer encouragement, warmth, understanding,
and direction.
</p>

<p>
There is no lonelier person than someone who has decided to
take his or her own life.  The decision is the ultimate form of
self-isolation.  It is the ultimate admission that one's imprisonment is
final and that there is no escape.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the decision to take one's life is reversible, if the
person is helped in time.  The help may come from within or from
without, but it always involves the <i>recognition of hope</i> that the
self-imprisonment may not be final, that there are others who
would help, that, even for someone who is terminally ill, there
may be periods of satisfaction and joy that make living worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
Western European, American, and Japanese societies are very
control-oriented.  There is much evidence that when members of
these societies are emotionally troubled they often perceive a
fault within themselves.  They see their troubles as springing
from a loss of self-control: "Just pull yourself together!" "It's just
a matter of self-discipline, of <i>will</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The greater our sense of responsibility&mdash;the more we emphasize
personal control over our inner and outer affairs, the more
we see ourselves as individualists whose individualism is based
on strength of will, discipline, guts&mdash;the more we are <i>trapped by
the myth of self-sufficiency</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
</p>

<p>
People who as children were forced to become independent
too early, who lacked a long enough period of closeness to their
mothers, whose parents were immature and self-absorbed frequently
develop what is called <i>pseudo-self-sufficiency</i> or <i>premature
ego development</i>.  Such a person is the neurotically extreme
form of the "do-it-yourselfer."  He or she refuses to relinquish
control, whether to the car mechanic, the sewer cleaner, or a
lover.  There is an urgent and obsessive need to maintain control,
never to be "out of control."
</p>

<p>
For such people, anxiety, depression, and loneliness can be
especially devastating because they have walled themselves in to
such an extent that emotional growth and change are blocked.
</p>

<p>
Yet most of us share, to some extent, this belief in
self-sufficiency.  It is one of the most tenacious forms of
self-imprisonment that we have available to us, literally at our own
disposal.  It is a prison we often take great pride in.  Pride, control,
and self-sufficiency are usually close friends.  They keep us from
having <i>real</i> friends and stand in the way of our being good
friends to ourselves.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE FEAR OF BEING LABELED EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED
</p>

<p>
It is woven into the fabric of our society that we should
conform.  A young teenager from Australia now in a California
high school tries as quickly as possible to lose the accent that
differentiates her, that makes her the object of laughter.  The
same pressures motivate the stutterer to keep quiet, speaking
only when absolutely necessary.  The National Merit Scholar says
"ain't" among his school friends to be one of them.
</p>

<p>
Children are especially sensitive to covert expectations, the
implicit <i>shoulds</i> that are handed down from the adult world and
are frequently refashioned to fit the stages children move
through.
</p>

<p>
At each stage, the implicit maxims are <i>dress alike, talk alike,
think alike</i>.  Be "in."  Especially, have the same feelings, values,
and hopes.  Most of us are raised to fear being different because
we might come to be a lonely minority of one.
</p>

<p>
But when we become ill, especially if we are emotionally
troubled, the rules change radically.  Animals, from the aquarium
angelfish to the household dog or cat, seem to have an instinct to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
seek isolation when ill.  This tendency probably has evolved
because it contributes to survival: the sick animal can more
easily rally its energy for self-healing in quiet, undisturbed by
others of its kind.  And going off to be alone reduces the chance
that the animal will spread any disease it has.
</p>

<p>
Added to an animal's self-isolating tendency is the tendency to
hide the very <i>signs</i> of illness or injury.  An animal that shows
signs of injury or illness is immediately a target for predators
who look for the weaker members of the species.
</p>

<p>
We human beings also tend to choose solitude and to hide the
revealing symptoms of sickness or injury.  Admiral Byrd admitted
to these defenses only in his loneliness.  But it is important to
realize that hiding our feelings and isolating ourselves frequently
are not in our best interests.
</p>

<p>
Animals do not practice medicine, though many species are
capable of offering moral support and even a certain amount of
physical assistance, as in the case of a sick whale who may be
supported by its fellows in the water in order to breathe.  But
only we have developed medicine, and we have more recently
begun to develop ways to treat problems that affect our
emotions, attitudes, and behavior.  When individuals, perhaps
instinctively, distance themselves from others and bottle up their
malaise, they turn their backs on the educated assistance and
goodwill that are available.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we do so out of fear of treatment coupled with fear
of admitting that we are not as self-sufficient as we want to
believe.  But more often in the case of problems that directly
affect our moods&mdash;i.e., "psychological problems"&mdash;we feel
ashamed and afraid of the stigma, the disgrace, that our society
attaches to those who admit they have unhappy or confused
feelings.
</p>

<p>
There can be little doubt that society is unbalanced in
legitimating physical sickness while reacting with alarm and
repugnance to problems of a psychological nature.  Think of the
discrimination <i>against</i> psychological disorders, in favor of
physical complaints, practiced openly by nearly all health insurance
companies, offering reduced benefits for mental health.  Psychological
pain does not hurt any less because it
is emotionally based.  Even so, emotional distress is held suspect,
and insurance coverage for it, if not ruled out completely, is
frequently only partial.  It was, after all, not more than a century
ago that our mental hospitals were run with an inhumanity that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
still can send shivers down one's spine.  Unhappily, it is clear that
we have not entirely left this phase of our development: the film
<i>One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>, for example, points to continuing
inhumanity in some psychiatric hospitals.  And there is the
alleged case of a Ukrainian woman who was involuntarily
committed and held for some thirty years in a mental hospital.  She
was thought to be insane because, unfortunately, no one
involved in her case recognized her "gibberish" as Ukrainian!
</p>

<p>
Emotional and mental problems are still not accepted by many.
There is a fear of the unknown and a skepticism that psychological
problems are nothing more than signs that a person is
malingering, simply does not want to try to get better.  And there
is a gut-level anxiety when confronted by someone who, we
worry, "may be close to going over the edge."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
TEARING DOWN PRISON WALLS
</p>

<p>
What undue hardship this causes!  As wonderful as the body is,
we accept its imperfections, its susceptibility to disease and
injury.  But our brains, our minds, our spiritual dimension&mdash;how
less well we understand these in their greater complexity!  Is it
so strange and unacceptable that they should be prone to their
own problems, that they, too, may bring suffering?
</p>

<p>
Because society does not legitimate emotional pain, many
people are not able to see their own pain as legitimate.  So they
deny it, to themselves and to others.  But pain is usually a healthy
signal; it tells you that something is wrong: Withdraw your hand
from the fire!  Move your cramping legs!  Do something about
your abusive, alcoholic husband!  Get help for your depression!
</p>

<p>
Every one of these pains is a warning.  To ignore all except
those that are physical would be like saying that we are only
bodies, without feelings, without humanity.
</p>

<p>
When you are in pain, whatever its source and kind, pay
attention to it!  Pain is often what points to a better life.
</p>

<p>
It is surely better to cope with a label applied in ignorance by
some members of society, if this must be, than to live an
unsatisfying and painful life.  You must not manage your life just
to avoid the potentially critical judgment of people who are
ignorant of, or who refuse to acknowledge, the realities of human
psychology.  You can feel sure that among well-informed people,
if you have had to deal with alcoholism, drug abuse, a difficult
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
marriage, job depression, or any other "psychological" problem,
you will be thought to be just as "respectable" as if you had
coped with major surgery after an automobile accident.  In fact,
since overcoming a psychological difficulty demands a great deal
more of your own voluntary effort, coming up a winner will
increase your own self-respect and the respect, and even
admiration, of those whose judgment is meaningful.
</p>

<p>
The first step to freedom from pain is to become aware of the
walls of the prison that shut you in.  Only then can you begin to

PATHS TO HELP
</p>

<p class="quote2">
To wrench anything out of its accustomed course takes energy,
effort and pain.  It does great violence to the existing pattern.
Many people want change, both in the external world and in
their own internal world, but they are unwilling to undergo
the severe pain that must precede it.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
Rivers in extremely cold climates freeze over in winter.  In
the spring, when they thaw, the sound of ice cracking is an
incredibly violent sound.  The more extensive and severe the
freeze, the more thunderous the thaw.  Yet, at the end of the
cracking, breaking, violent period, the river is open, life-giving,
life-carrying.  No one says, "Let's not suffer the thaw;
let's keep the freeze; everything is quiet now."
<br /><br />
Mary E. Mebane, <i>Mary, Wayfarer</i>

<p>
If you decide to enter therapy, your therapist will probably ask
you to think about two interrelated questions (they may be
expressed in a variety of ways): "Where are you now?" and
"Where do you want to go?"  Your therapist or counselor will, as
he comes to know you, often be able to help you to answer these
by sharing his perceptions of you.  One of the main tasks of the
counseling process is to help a person gain improved
self-understanding that embraces both present problems and future
goals.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
</p>

<p>
Yet if you can gain a certain measure of self-understanding and
self-direction <i>before</i> entering counseling or therapy, it will be
easier for you to choose an approach to counseling or therapy
that more closely fits your problems, values, objectives, available
time, and even your financial needs.  You should find in this book
a basis for preliminary <i>self</i>-counseling that will give you a sense
of how and where best to begin therapy.
</p>

<p>
It is important to recognize that none of us ever reaches a final
state of self-knowledge: as long as we live, our self-understanding
is capable of growing.  What we really understand about
ourselves and what we believe ourselves to need and want are
never more than provisional, tentative.  Additional experience,
just the fact of living longer, very likely will lead you to perceive
yourself differently and motivate you to modify your priorities
and change your goals.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
</p>

<p>
Late in 1984, the National Institute of Mental Health released
the first published results of the largest mental health survey
ever conducted.  The results are startling and are an unhappy
commentary on our society and world.
</p>

<p>
The report shows that 20 percent of Americans suffer from
psychiatric disorders.  Yet only one in five of these seeks help.
The others live with their suffering.
</p>

<p>
The most common problems are these:
</p>

<pre>
                                           <i>Millions of Americans</i>
  <i>Psychiatric Name of Condition            with This Disorder</i>

  Anxiety disorders                                13.1
  Phobias                                          11.1
  Substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, etc.)           10.0
  Affective disorders (including
    depression and manic depression)                9.4
  Obsessive-compulsive disorders                    2.4
  Cognitive impairment                              1.6
  Schizophrenia                                     1.5
  Antisocial personality                            1.4
</pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The NIMH study also shows that women are twice as likely to
seek help as men.  Two interrelated inferences are commonly
made from this previously known fact: women are often more
accepting of their emotional state (men in our society are taught
to disregard their feelings, part of <i>machismo</i>), and women are
less willing to allow pride to stand in their way of getting help
(women are less affected by the myth of self-sufficiency).
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
</p>

<p>
The NIMH report indicates, too, that the incidence of psychological
problems drops by approximately half after the age of
forty-five.  The below-forty-five years are usually those of highest
stress.  Above forty-five, individuals tend to become psychologically
better integrated.  This probably reflects increased maturity
and a more accepting, calmer attitude toward life.  The lowest
rate of emotional disturbance appears to be in people over sixty-five.
Yet there are many thousands of individuals over forty-five,
and indeed over sixty-five, for whom life remains a difficult inner
struggle.
</p>

<p>
The statistics from the NIMH study reveal how very wide-spread
personal psychological difficulties are.  Given the degree
of complexity of our mental, emotional, and spiritual makeup,
this should be understandable, especially when we take into
account twentieth-century stresses that wear us down.  Caught
up as most of us are in our jobs, families, and daily worries, we
are unaware that, in a very real sense, mental and emotional
health problems have assumed epidemic proportions.  If you bear
in mind how fearful our society encourages us to be of admitting
such difficulties, you can perhaps imagine how substantial the
"iceberg" of psychological suffering is: most of it lies below the
waterline of public consciousness.
</p>

<p>
The NIMH study results should encourage you, if you suffer
from personal emotional difficulties, to realize that you are not
alone in the problems you face.  Knowing that there are many
good and fine individuals with very likely similar problems may
urge you to take an honest look at where you are now and then
to try to decide what changes may be helpful to you: where you
want to go from here.
</p>

<p>
If you are fortunate, you may already be aware of the main
things in you and in your life that bring you distress.  If so, you are
one step closer to being able to do something about them.  Many
of us, however, have become so clever and effective in denying
what we really feel that we have lost touch with our true selves.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
Desires to repair an unhappy marriage are shelved while the
children are growing up; the unrewarding nature of a job is
ignored because priority is given to financial security; you may
be unable or unwilling to face the pain you bring to yourself and
others as a result of a drug- or alcohol-abuse habit.
</p>

<p>
In most cases, it is not possible to gain the motivation and
means to solve a problem until you are willing to accept that
there is a problem that needs to be solved.
</p>

<p>
Because of the blinding nature of the habits you may have
established, and because of your defensive desires to disregard
what disturbs the equilibrium of habit, it may be hard to acquire
a clear picture of where you stand right now.  Sometimes it can
be useful to check with others: how do they see you?
</p>

<p>
A close friend of mine, after years in her profession, began
rather suddenly to feel how unrewarding her job was, and she
began to suspect that she may have hidden these feelings for a
long time.  She had maintained a regular, almost once-a-week
exchange of letters with her mother for twelve years.  She knew
that her mother kept her letters, so she went to visit her and
asked if she might skim through them, paying attention to
comments she had made over the years about her work.  It
quickly became clear to her that, consistently, she had had only
very negative things to say about her job.  After skimming
through dozens of letters written over a period of years, she
became convinced of her real and enduring feelings and changed
her line of work.
</p>

<p>
Such self-knowledge does not usually come this easily.  We may
pride ourselves on honesty, but there are few of us who permit
ourselves self-honesty to any real degree.  Existential-humanistic
psychologists have paid much attention to these ways that we
live "in bad faith"&mdash;each of us trying to be a person he or she
really is not and denying the person he or she really is.
</p>

<p>
We live in a society that emphasizes conformity, "being
somebody," gaining status and wealth and a good position&mdash;yet
these values may not coincide with being true to ourselves.
Parental influences can be strong, as can expectations from our
spouses.  We internalize many of these values so that it becomes
difficult to see who we really are and what we really want from
life and from our efforts.
</p>

<p>
There are no easy routes to self-realization.  We must all do a
certain amount of hunting in the dark&mdash;or, as a colleague of mine
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
likes to say, "scrabbling about"&mdash;for a sense of real identity.
</p>

<p>
Recognizing that your self-understanding is probably always
imperfect does not mean that it is of little value.  It is, in the end,
all any of us has to go on.
</p>

<p>
It may be useful to ask people close to you what they perceive
about you.  Reading through a group of old letters, keeping a
journal, or simply setting aside a few minutes for self-appraisal at
the end of each day or week may also be enlightening.  If you do
this self-examination, gradually where you are and what you feel
will become clearer, and then it will be natural and appropriate
to ask what the next step is.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t2b">
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?  WHAT KIND OF<br />
PERSON DO YOU WANT TO BECOME?
</p>

<p>
Influences from society, your parents, your spouse, or your
close friends make it difficult for you to know yourself.  Defensive
habits and fear of change also stand in the way.  These are
significant blocks to self-understanding.
</p>

<p>
When you turn your attention to the future, to what kind of
person you want to become, you will encounter more blocks to
overcome.  Life is like that!  It seems that few things come without
effort and perseverance.
</p>

<p>
There are two major obstacles to designing the model of the
person you would like to become.  Because they can be so
important, I want to introduce them early in this book.  They are
blame and guilt, and they are like the two ends of a seesaw.
</p>

<p>
When we appraise what we have done in our lives, we usually
find reasons to blame others, or perhaps to blame limited
educational opportunities, or social pressures, or discrimination&mdash;in
short, our past environment: all the factors that limited
our lives, interfered with the attainment of our hopes, and were
not under our control.
</p>

<p>
On the other end of the seesaw sits guilt.  And guilt is really
blame turned inward.
</p>

<p>
If we try to pinpoint the factors that have been responsible for
our lives not having turned out better, we tend to blame
environmental limitations, or else we feel guilt for what we see
as our own failings.  Usually, we locate responsibility in both
areas.
</p>

<p>
Most of us, however, have unbalanced seesaws.  We usually
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
blame things <i>outside ourselves</i> for our disappointments.  Doing
so is a habit that allows us to avoid responsibility for ourselves
and, in turn, limits our future development.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, some of us blame ourselves much too
readily: we carry an exaggerated burden of responsibility, which
weighs us down and also limits our growth as individuals.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, psychotherapy would like us to let go of so-called "past
negative conditioning"&mdash;blame as well as guilt&mdash;so that we are
free to choose who we are and will become.  Even though this is
certainly a desirable attitude, most of us cannot really forget and
let go.  We are all inheritors of a tenacious past: the influences of
past events have a certain power over us, and we must either
resign ourselves to being controlled by the past or fight its
influence.  The <i>attitude</i> we take toward the past will usually
affect how we meet the future, often diminishing our freedom to
change old habits and undermining our hope and faith in
ourselves.
</p>

<p>
For example, if Jeff blames his limitations today on his parents,
on the ways they influenced him, he may set goals for himself
that are far from being freely chosen.  Jeff may choose them <i>in
reaction to</i> domination by his parents years ago.  His parents may
have tried to influence him to be a gentle, courteous person with
artistic interests.  But as a result of other past influences&mdash;for
example, because of frequent moves of the family and repeatedly
being bullied as the "new kid" at different schools&mdash;Jeff may feel
hostile toward others, so (in reaction to his parents' influence
and because of pent-up hostility) he decides to go into science
(rather than art, for which he perhaps has a talent) and rejects
gentle, courteous qualities in himself.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to choose freely.  Some psychologists do not
believe it actually is possible.  And yet, whether we are ever truly
free or not, we still try to plan our lives, and we believe our plans
(and frequently the lack of them) have something to do with
what we make of living.
</p>

<p>
Most people who enter counseling or psychotherapy want to
improve some aspect of their living.  Individuals whose seesaw is
weighted on the side of blaming outside influences too often
come to feel it is too much work and quit therapy because they
cannot accept the need to make choices and decisions <i>in spite of</i>
past influences.  On the other hand, people who blame
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
themselves may be so guilt-ridden that they are impaired in their
openness to the future and feel unable to initiate fundamental
changes in their lives.
</p>

<p>
When you ask yourself, "What kind of person do I want to
become?," try to be aware of the extent that your answer may be
weighed down by feelings of blame and guilt.  All too often we
continue to perpetuate, unknowingly, the same old unsatisfying
patterns because we are trapped by our habits of blaming others
or ourselves.
</p>

<p>
If you feel bogged down by feelings of guilt or burdened by the
limitations of an unfair past, it may be difficult for you to develop
a freely chosen sense of direction.  But perhaps you will be able
to acknowledge that the guilt or blame you feel is an obstacle to
be overcome.  If so, you have defined an objective that you may
use to decide what type of counseling or therapy may be a most
promising first step.
</p>

<p>
What I am suggesting is that an obstacle that makes it hard for
you to gain a sense of direction can <i>itself</i> point you in a direction.
If there are blocks, it can be helpful to meet them head-on.  In
therapy, the phrase <i>working through a problem</i> often means
exactly this.
</p>

<p>
Choosing what kind of person you wish to be is a <i>process</i>, not
an event.  It is not something that happens and then is over.
Choice is something implicit in each day of your life; sometimes
it is quite conscious, but it is often dulled by the unconsciousness
of habit.  Your personal goals may undergo gradual or abrupt
change.  Psychological growth is your response to these changes
in outlook.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t2b">
WHAT DOES THERAPY TRY TO DO?
</p>

<p>
Individual therapy or counseling (therapy for groups and
families will be discussed in detail later) is really an attempt to
build a bridge between answers to these two now familiar
questions: "Where are you now, or what kind of person are you
now?" and "Where do you want to go, or what kind of person do
you want to become?"  Think of therapy as an attempt to build a
bridge so that you can pass from a present situation to a desired
way of being.

Carl Rogers defines therapy as "a relationship in which at least
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
one of the parties has the intent of promoting the growth,
development, maturity, improved functioning, improved coping
with life of the other."[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]

<p>
Therapy involves a three-fold relationship among a helping
professional, the approach to therapy used by him or her, and,
what is most important, the outlook of the individual client.  In
this book we will examine each of these three dimensions of
therapy in some detail, but here we will concentrate on the one
therapists generally agree is the most important: you&mdash;the kind
of person you are, what your attitudes and outlook are, and, of
course, how much you really want to develop or change.  Your
attitudes will determine, probably more than anything else, what
variety of therapy you will most benefit from.
</p>

<p>
Therapists, like teachers (which they really are), find that
their clients or patients can be divided into two groups: active
and passive learners.  When you go to a doctor with a broken arm,
your relationship to your doctor is a <i>passive</i> one: you need only
to cooperate as he examines your arm, perhaps administers an
anesthetic, and sets the break.  You may take medication for pain,
and then you simply <i>wait</i> until, thanks to the body's automatic
healing processes, the break is fused.  The public's conception of
medicine is predominately a passive one.  To be a "patient" is for
the most part to be a passive bystander: the physician is the
active agent who brings about healing.  There are occasional
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
exceptions&mdash;for example, physical therapy and rehabilitation
therapy after a serious injury or illness, when the patient must
become more active and accept more responsibility.
</p>

<p>
As we will see, a few approaches to counseling and psychotherapy
preserve, to some extent, the traditionally passive role
of the patient.  Most of them, however, require a good deal of
initiative and just plain hard work on the part of the patient
or client.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In building the house of one's life or in its remodeling, one may
delegate nothing; for the task can be done, if at all, only in the
workshop of one's own mind and heart, in the most intimate
rooms of thinking and feeling where none but one's self has
freedom of movement or competence or authority.  The
responsibility lies with him who suffers, originates with him,
remains with him to the end.  It will be no less his if he enlists
the aid of a therapist; we are no more the product of our
therapist than of our genes; we create ourselves.  The sequence
is suffering, insight, will, action, change.  The one who suffers,
who wants to change, must bear responsibility all the way.
"Must" because so soon as responsibility is ascribed [outside
oneself] the forces resisting change occupy the whole of one's
being, and the process of change comes to a halt.  A psychiatrist
may help, perhaps crucially, but his best help will be of no avail
if he is required to provide a degree of insight which will of
itself achieve change.[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>]

WHY IS IT SO COMPLICATED?
</p>

<p>
For better or for worse, human nature is a many-splendored
thing.  It doesn't take an advanced degree in psychotherapy to
know that people can have many different kinds of personal
problems.  This fact, if we appreciate it fully, makes more
understandable why there are so many alternative approaches to
helping people with their difficulties.
</p>

<p>
In the world of theory, a <i>model</i> is a simplified representation
of reality.  Your checking account record is a model, in just this
sense, of how many real dollars and cents you have in the bank.
</p>

<p>
Here is a much simplified model that represents five main
psychological, emotion-laden dimensions of a person:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-026"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-026.jpg" alt="Five main psychological dimensions of a person: feelings, hopes, abilities, relationships with others, and behavior" />
<br />
Five main psychological dimensions of a person: feelings, <br />
hopes, abilities, relationships with others, and behavior
</p>

<p>
We see right away that, for the same reasons that there are
specialties in medicine&mdash;e.g., orthopedy for bones, neurology
for nerves, dentistry for teeth&mdash;there should be special
approaches that focus on different psychological dimensions of the
person.
</p>

<p>
Something else you may see is that the five dimensions in the
model are not isolated from one another.  They interrelate and
overlap a good deal.  Just as a dentist must know about the
orthopedy of the jaw and skull and the neurology of the teeth a
neurologist and an orthopedist are expected to know something,
though not in great detail, about dentition.  Each of us is a
unity of what all the medical and psychological specialties study
in different ways, plus a good deal more, as artists, writers,
theologians, and musicians make evident.
</p>

<p>
That more than 130 distinguishable therapies have now been
developed may perhaps strike us, even so, as excessive.  But
efforts are being made to unify many of these approaches, and
this book is one of them.  Rather than talking about 130 different
approaches, we will center our attention on the main categories
into which the many approaches can be sorted.
</p>

<p>
One of the interesting and hopeful things that can be said
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
about the multiplicity of approaches to therapy and counseling
is that treatment by any one of them can often be of some help.
For example, Helen may wish to stop drinking (a habit in the
behavior category), and she may be helped by means of behavior
modification.  She may then find that, as a direct result, her
self-concept (feeling category) has grown stronger, while her
marriage (relationship category) has also improved.  Or, Ralph may
go to a vocational counselor who helps him define a direction
(hope category) in keeping with his interests and aptitudes.
Ralph goes back to school and develops a background (abilities
category) that reflects these aptitudes and interests.  The sense
of direction he has gained helps Ralph stop using drugs (behavior),
reduces his hostility and anxiety (feelings), and improves
his relationships with others.  In other words, a helpful change in
one direction can often lead to noticeable changes in others.
</p>

<p>
However, there also are risks that we should not ignore: Sue
goes to an analyst and learns over a period of months that her
marriage to Fred was based on a sense of inadequacy Sue learned
during her childhood.  Her father was so highly controlling and
critical of her that she was never able to develop a sense of her
own value.  Her husband, Fred, is also domineering and authoritarian,
and he abuses Sue frequently, usually mistreating her
through criticism, but he has sometimes also beaten her physically.
Sue has accepted this without question for a long time, but
due to the emotional support received from her analyst, she is
beginning to develop a sense of self-esteem.  As her self-esteem
grows, she comes to realize that her marriage is a self-destructive
relationship and decides to divorce Fred.  Her therapy has been
helpful to Sue, but it has, indirectly, resulted in a breakdown of
her admittedly unhappy marriage.  A change in one dimension
can sometimes lead to an initially unintended change in another
area.

<p class="t2b">
IF IT HURTS, DON'T PROCRASTINATE!
</p>

<p>
One of the marvelous things about human nature is the ability
to feel pain.  This may seem like an odd thing to say, but reflect
for a moment.  Pain is frequently what spurs us on from an
unsatisfying and even destructive situation to a better future.
Pain tells you to jerk your hand away from a hot stove.  A different
kind of pain tells you it is time to get on with living, time to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
initiate some positive changes.  Anxiety, sleeplessness, irritability,
resentment, depression&mdash;they all can be painful inner feelings
that tell us that all is not well in our inner selves.
</p>

<p>
It is well-known to counselors and therapists that, in general,
the longer these signs of need are ignored, the longer it may take
to help a person resolve the difficulties that have been pressing
for attention.  Distress is not easily buried.  When suppressed, it
tends to pop up again later, sometimes with increased severity.
</p>

<p>
We can, ironically, choose to be "strong" and ignore these
messages from within, or we can listen to our feelings, pay
attention to our hopes, develop needed abilities, seek to improve
our relationships with others, and work to change some ways we
behave that block our happiness.
</p>

<p>
Problems that concern your inner well-being and the health of
your relationships with others who are important to you are
better resolved than buried, and the earlier they are given the
attention they deserve, the easier your path through change to a
better life will be.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIELD OF THERAPY
</p>

<p class="t3">
THE HELPING PROFESSIONAL
</p>

<p>
Professionals in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy have
a wide range of different backgrounds and perspectives.  They
can be broken down into these categories:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>Social work counselors</i>: counselors for individuals; marriage and
family counselors; group counselors; and vocational guidance
counselors
</p>

<p>
<i>Psychologists</i>: clinical psychologists; counseling psychologists;
and psychometrists
</p>

<p>
<i>Psychiatrists</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Other therapists</i>: religious counselors; biofeedback therapists;
hypnotherapists; relaxation and meditation instructors; holistic
therapists such as bioenergetics therapists, yoga instructors, and
exercise therapists; etc.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The education, supervised training, and outlooks of these
professionals vary greatly, as do their fees and the average length
of time therapy can be expected to last.  We will look more
closely at these differences later on.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
THE RANGE OF APPROACHES TO THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Because of their differences in training and personal or
theoretical preferences, the distinct classes of therapists
represent a diversity of approaches to therapy.  There are numerous
schools of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, behavioral therapy,
group therapy, and marriage and family therapy, and a range of
approaches to personal adjustment, including exercise therapies,
relaxation techniques, forms of meditation, and drug and
nutrition therapies.
</p>

<p>
From any one of these, a multitude of schools of thought
branches out.  For example, psychoanalysis has, since Freud,
developed along a number of different lines: each major
psychoanalyst has formulated his or her own approach to analysis that
distinguishes itself from Freud's.  Psychotherapy, to take another
example, is not a single approach to therapy, but rather makes up
an entire field.  It is the largest and most rapidly growing area
relating to mental health.  In it are included distinct approaches,
such as client-centered therapy, Gestalt therapy, transactional
analysis, rational-emotive therapy, existential-humanistic
therapy, reality therapy, logotherapy, Adlerian therapy, emotional
flooding therapies, and direct decision therapy.
</p>

<p>
In later chapters, we will look at these approaches to
psychotherapy more closely.  The goal throughout this book will be to
enable you to understand enough about each of the major
therapies to make an informed decision in choosing an approach
(and there may be more than one) that will be most useful in
relation to your own understanding of your objectives, whether
they are long-range or focused on the need to eliminate
immediate obstacles to growth.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COUNSELING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
Counseling and psychotherapy have developed a great deal in
recent years&mdash;so much so that their boundaries have often
overlapped.  Clear-cut distinctions between the two fields are
increasingly hard to draw.  Nevertheless, some professionals
prefer to call themselves by one name and some by the other.
</p>

<p>
In general terms, <i>counseling</i> tends to be a short-term process
the purpose of which is to help the client, couple, or family
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
overcome specific problems and eliminate blocks to growth.
Counseling gives individuals a chance to resolve personal
problems and concerns.  Most counselors attempt to help their clients
become aware of a widened range of possibilities of choice; from
this perspective, counseling tries to free clients from rigid
patterns of habit.
</p>

<p>
Habits can be useful, but they can also interfere with life.  The
technical habits of a pianist, for example, are essential in
performance.  Similarly, only when language skills become
habitual does a speaker of a foreign language achieve command of it.
On the other hand, fears can also become habitual, and they
may come to interfere with everyday activities.  Anxiety over
public speaking may become habitual.  There are many
personally destructive habits&mdash;alcoholism, smoking, over- or
under-eating, abusive behavior, shyness and social withdrawal&mdash;and all
can become self-perpetuating patterns.  Counseling can help
people break out of these habits, often in part by helping clients
become aware of unrecognized alternatives.
</p>

<p>
<i>Psychotherapy</i> tends to be more concerned than counseling
with fundamental personality-structure changes.  Frequently,
psychotherapy is a longer-term process.  Frequently, too, the
problems treated in psychotherapy are hard to pin down and are
less specific.  They include chronic depression, pervasive
("free-floating") anxiety, generalized lack of self-esteem, and so on.
Such difficulties are not well defined; their causes may be vague
or uncertain, and often much time must be spent to get at their
basis.  Psychotherapy seeks to bring about an intensive
self-awareness of the <i>inner dynamics</i>&mdash;the internal forces and the
principles that govern them&mdash;that are involved in chronic forms
of personal distress.  Sometimes, as in analytical psychotherapy
or psychoanalysis, attention is focused on the role of
unconscious processes in inner conflicts; treatment attempts to
resolve these conflicts by understanding the unconscious forces
involved.
</p>

<p>
The term <i>psychotherapy</i> is often used to imply more advanced
professional training, whereas counseling is something
individuals with more modest academic credentials may practice.
Whether a professional is called a counselor or a therapist has to
do with his or her level of training, with the setting in which
services are offered, and, to a certain degree, with that person's
theoretical orientation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
</p>

<p>
In practice, these differences in outlook frequently amount to
differences in <i>emphasis</i> rather than approach.  In this book, I will
speak of counseling and psychotherapy interchangeably unless
there is a need to be especially restrictive.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
THERAPY: THE ART OF CHANGE
</p>

<p class="t3">
HOW WE ARE ABLE TO CHANGE
</p>

<p class="quote2">
We are what we do ... and may do what we choose.
<br /><br />
Allen Wheelis, <i>How People Change</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
Freud identified five causes of personality development:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  * growth and maturation<br />
  * frustration<br />
  * conflict<br />
  * inadequacy<br />
  * anxiety<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
By the time we become adults, most of us have developed sets of
defenses to enable us to cope with everyday problems <i>in spite of</i>
feelings of frustration, conflict, inadequacy, and anxiety.  But as
these feelings become more pronounced, when we encounter
situations that intensify these feelings, we must put more and
more energy into our defenses.  They allow us to continue living
and acting in habitual ways, usually by hiding, by denying, and
sometimes by distorting our perceptions of reality.
</p>

<p>
Facing the inadequacies of a marriage, the unrewarding nature
of a job, the extent of conflicts with a child, or difficulties
relating to friends can cause intense anxiety.  So, to avoid this
anxiety, we frequently "defend against" these realizations: we
try to uphold the belief that our marriages are just fine, that
things are OK between us and our children, that our jobs are at
least tolerable&mdash;that, in spite of some problems "here and
there," we can get along all right.  We do, in short, try to see our
lives through rose-tinted glasses.
</p>

<p>
We continue to do this until our negative feelings become too
strong, until we have expended so much energy to maintain our
defenses that we are <i>emotionally exhausted</i>.  If we reach such a
state of real depletion, and our defenses can no longer hold
against the building pressure of our feelings, the result is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
<i>nervous breakdown</i>.  This is the layman's name for a variety of
psychological conditions that develop due to <i>a burned-out
emotional fuse</i>.
</p>

<p>
A fuse is a protective device that prevents an overload of
electricity.  Our defense mechanisms are analogous devices that
protect us against emotional overload.  When an emotional fuse
burns out, it is often because we have maintained defenses too
long in the face of increasing inner frustration and pain.  The
result may involve severe depression, incapacitating anxiety, or
serious withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
Now, when you decide to change in some psychologically
fundamental way, you must push against the rigid framework of
certain of these protective defenses.  When you do this, you will
feel anxiety.  You are forcing your emotional fuses to adjust to a
different pattern of behavior and feelings.
</p>

<p>
Your sense of personal identity is made up of a network of
ways you have come to perceive yourself, your loved ones, your
work, and your world.  Any attempt&mdash;even if it is your own,
entered into through your own choosing&mdash;to change patterns
that are psychologically basic to your sense of identity will
threaten that established identity and produce a measure of
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
The longer these habitual patterns of behavior and feeling
have been in force, the more deeply rooted they become in your
sense of identity, and the more unsettling and anxiety-producing
an attempt to change them will be.
</p>

<p>
Although your defenses protect against emotional overload,
they also stand in your way of change.  They are fundamentally
<i>conservative</i> mechanisms: established habits of thought, feeling,
and behavior are <i>familiar</i>, and familiarity reduces the anxiety
brought about by uncertainty.  If you are considering making
significant changes in your life, your defenses will rally to
protect the equilibrium of habits you have formed in the past.  If
you push yourself to change, you will face a predictable degree
of anxiety.  Fortunately, there are, as we shall see, many ways of
coping with the anxiety brought about by change; therapy offers
some of these, and some are available to us all if we draw on
inner resources.
</p>

<p>
As long as you are alive it is possible to change.  Ultimately, the
decision to change is an expression of your choice and will.
When change <i>is</i> achieved, it usually comes after long and
arduous trying.  We are all aware of the heroic efforts some
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
people can and do make to overcome a physical handicap.
Overcoming deeply entrenched emotional habits can require
similar tenacity and commitment.  If you want to bring about
some basic changes in yourself or in your relationships with
others, your inner strength and resolve will be essential.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, individuals expect a therapist to accomplish
change <i>for</i> them: they are willing to come for an hour's
consultation once or twice a week, and they will be very cooperative
during each visit, but they seem unwilling or unable to develop
the initiative to carry on efforts begun in the therapist's office.
</p>

<p>
Some clients, in spite of what they say, do not really <i>want</i> to
change.  Their habits are deeply ingrained, serving purposes they
may be only dimly aware of at the beginning of therapy.  Sometimes
it becomes necessary in therapy to reappraise the goals
that have been set.  The decision to pursue a certain course of
change may result in so much anxiety and upset that both
therapist and client must pause to reconsider.  Some changes may
turn out to be too difficult, too taxing; some clients may be
unwilling to put in the work required to bring about a certain
change.
</p>

<p>
Most changes of the kind I am referring to&mdash;fundamental
changes in outlook, in daily thoughts and feelings, in behavior&mdash;can
be made only gradually.  Since any move in the direction of
change will threaten your existing defenses, resistance and
protest are likely to well up from within you.  New ways of <i>being</i>
will feel intimidating, unpleasant, or just plain <i>unnatural</i>.  And
this is understandable, is it not?  You must confront and do battle
against habits that may have been with you for a long time.  <i>The
longer that undesirable patterns have been in force, the more
control they acquire over you, and the more your defenses
become committed to preserving them</i>.  Change is made steadily
more difficult.
</p>

<p>
Always remember, however, that change can be brought
about.  You need to be patient with yourself; it will not come
overnight.  Long-standing habits take time to be replaced,  You
must have patience, and you must feel hope and encouragement.
If you are depressed now, if maintaining your defenses has
exhausted you, then it will be difficult to feel the measure of
hope that you need to begin the process of therapy.
</p>

<p>
This, perhaps more than anything else, is the most immediate
and perceptible benefit of therapy: a good therapist is a source
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
for hope and encouragement when you cannot sustain these
yourself.  Therapists are trained to help people who want to
change, to bring it about.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE RESULTS OF THERAPY
</p>

<p>
In the past twenty to thirty years, there has been a gradual shift
away from a medical, illness-based orientation in therapy to one
that focuses on personal growth.  By no means everyone enters
therapy because of emotional pain.  Increasingly, therapists are
seeing clients who enjoy psychological and emotional good
health but believe that therapy can help them lead fuller, richer,
more satisfying lives.  As a consequence, the objectives of many
current approaches to therapy involve more than only the
resolution of personal difficulties and crises.
</p>

<p>
There are many potential benefits of therapy.  To varying
degrees, all the therapies we will discuss in this book claim to
assist you in achieving the following goals.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Resilience and Tolerance to Stress</i>
</p>

<p>
As a consequence of therapy, you come to be less frustrated by
stress, able to recover from stressful experiences more quickly.
You become less defensive and more accepting of others and
yourself, able to adjust more easily to unexpected demands in
living.  You have a decreased tendency to hold rigid expectations
of the world, so you feel less disappointment and frustration.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Congruence</i>
</p>

<p>
You come to be more unified in the present moment, aware of
your feelings, and less disposed to ignore, deny, or distort your
perceptions out of defensive needs.  Congruence means a close
match between what you feel and how you think and act.
Congruent people are well integrated, no longer in need of
"masks."  When we admire a person's sense of "integrity," we
often feel that the person not only behaves in ways that show
self-respect, but that he or she is self-accepting, is genuine, and
appears to be comparatively free of inner conflict.  Such individuals
are, in short, able to be themselves.  People who no longer
are engaged in a battle against themselves and against others will
tend to show congruence.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Self-Esteem</i>
</p>

<p>
People with high self-esteem can allow themselves to feel
modest and to behave with modesty.  High self-esteem does not
imply pride or arrogance.  Self-esteem and self-acceptance (and
hence congruence) are interrelated.  Individuals with strong
self-esteem no longer need to prove themselves.  They value the
kind of people they are and are not inclined to be self-undermining
through perfectionistic self-criticism.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Openness and Love</i>
</p>

<p>
Ideally, if you undergo therapy, you become less defensive and
less uptight about yourself; you will therefore have less need for
self-absorption, so you will be able to develop an increased
capacity to feel warmth for others.  You may become more giving,
and less hooked on the need to recover for what you do give, tit
for tat.  There are fewer "shoulds" to stand in your way, to use to
blame yourself, or to use to criticize others.  You can let go of
these requirements and accept others for what they are, for what
they can do, and for what they may feel.  You feel less
disappointment and resentment about your relationships and more of a
sense of ease and peace.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Freedom</i>
</p>

<p>
Since you are less hooked by the expectations and values of
others, and you have reduced the list of requirements that others
must fulfill in order to be acceptable, you gain a great measure of
personal freedom.  The habitual process of sizing others up and
comparing them with yourself, which many of us expend so
much time and energy doing, is no longer needed.  You can more
freely set your life goals.  You will probably feel more real,
meaningful satisfaction with your life, since you are no longer
imprisoned by uptight standards of judgment.  You are able to be
much more relaxed because you are able to feel more accepting
toward others and toward yourself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Displacing the Negative with the Positive</i>
</p>

<p>
These are among the major potential positive benefits of
therapy.  They make up one way of describing the <i>ideal outcomes</i>
of therapy.  They are one side of the coin; the other side consists
of the many negative feelings and ways of behaving that are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
eliminated when they are <i>displaced</i> by these positive personality
qualities.  The negatives that make up such a familiar part of
"normal" life include these:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* fears that stand in the way of desired goals
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* anxiety and depression that cripple normal living
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* low self-esteem, resentment, and hostility that poison the
formation and development of satisfying relationships
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* incapacity to deal with stress, and dependence on alcohol,
drugs, or other means to reduce anxiety
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* inability to accept yourself, your family, or your present
place in the world&mdash;which often leads to bitterness,
withdrawal, and even the cultivation of fantasies that
further isolate
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* confusion, disorientation, and perhaps even physical signs
of poor health, as a result of emotions that have assumed a
magnitude that can no longer be held in check by tired
defenses
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
We tend to think of these as the usual reasons for entering
therapy.  But, again, the positive qualities we have described are
attracting clients increasingly to therapy.  Whether you need to
eliminate emotional pain or are fortunate to be comparatively
untroubled but are searching for certain positive qualities of
perspective and character that you believe will bring increased
satisfaction to your living, therapy may offer what you are
seeking.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHAT MAKES A GOOD THERAPIST?
</p>

<p>
According to several studies, certain qualities in therapists are
associated with effective therapy.  The kind of person who is able
to help others bring about important life changes has these
qualities:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* the ability to understand the client's feelings and life
world
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* heightened sensitivity to the client's feelings and attitudes
so that the therapist frequently is able to uncover
significant aspects of the client's outlook and personality
of which the client would probably remain unaware
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* warmth of interest in the client's well-being, without
emotional overinvolvement
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* psychological maturity, characterized by self-acceptance,
genuineness, and congruence
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* a sense of acceptance toward the client: a nonjudgmental,
noncritical, positive regard for the client, his separateness,
and individuality
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* an attitude, conveyed by the therapist's behavior and
approach, that encourages positive change, independence,
and freely made choices and decisions, and implicitly
discourages the formation of long-term dependence of the
client on the therapist
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These studies also identified several attitudes that clients,
regardless of the orientation of their therapists, felt were
especially <i>counterproductive</i> in some therapists:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* lack of interest
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* remoteness or distance
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* excessive sympathy
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In general, clients whose evaluations of therapy have been
studied appear to be in agreement that the personal character,
attitudes, and feelings of therapists are more important than a
therapist's technique, procedures, and theoretical orientation.
Therapy is an intrinsically human process, one that is especially
sensitive to the human dimensions of therapists.  Later we will
look at objective evaluations of the effectiveness of various
approaches to therapy and weigh them against the emphasis that
clients place on the personal qualities of therapists.

  THE THERAPEUTIC JUNGLE,<br />
  PART I<br />
</p>

<p class="t3b">
Social Workers, Psychologists, and Psychiatrists
</p>

<p class="quote2">
I have reluctantly come to concede the possibility that the
process, direction, and end points of therapy may differ in
different therapeutic orientations.
<br /><br />
Carl Rogers, <i>On Becoming a Person</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
Fifty years ago, people with personal or marital problems had a
choice between two main kinds of assistance: psychoanalysis
and religion.  Freud's approach to psychiatry had gained
popularity among physicians, psychoanalytic training was being made
available to clinical psychologists, and the ideas of Freudian
analysis had come to dominate the public's conception of
therapy.  And, sometimes overlooked in this context, the church&mdash;the
world's faithful and oldest psychiatrist&mdash;continued to offer
spiritual and personal guidance.
</p>

<p>
These two basic choices have expanded into an impressive&mdash;and
confusing&mdash;array of different therapies.  The more than one
hundred varieties of counseling, even when they are grouped
together, cannot be reduced to fewer than perhaps twenty
families of therapies.
</p>

<p>
Different counseling professions have evolved that now range
from social work to psychotherapy to psychiatry; religious
counseling is still offered; and there are the newer therapies of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
relaxation training, biofeedback, bioenergetics, etc., as well as a
renaissance of older approaches such as meditation, yoga, and
holistic practice.  The choices of fifty years ago seem modest,
limited, and certainly less perplexing.  However, the recent
proliferation of therapies has brought with it increased
sensitivity, sophistication, and effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
In spite of this growth of therapeutic options, most people
who decide to enter therapy are unaware of the choices open to
them and so cannot intelligently weigh their alternatives.  This
and the next chapter will help you to see clearly what
alternatives exist.  As the book helps you to clarify your personal
objectives, you will be able to home in on one or more
approaches to therapy that may be especially promising for you,
your temperament, interests, and goals.  You will be encouraged
to follow a "map" that will guide you to several approaches to
therapy, to help you find the shortest and most effective route to
where you want to go.

<p class="t3b">
SOCIAL WORK COUNSELORS
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, the four main categories of social work
counselors are counselors for individuals, marriage and family
counselors, group counselors, and vocational guidance
counselors.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
ORIENTATION AND TRAINING
</p>

<p>
The main purpose of social work is to help people cope with
stress from interpersonal or social problems.  The focus of the
social worker may therefore be on individuals, families, or
groups or on their social and work environments, their
organizations, and their communities.
</p>

<p>
Social workers are trained to deal with developmental problems,
life crises, and emotional problems that arise in a variety of
social situations.
</p>

<p>
Graduate schools of social work require varying periods of
supervised internship; they usually offer specializations within
the field&mdash;e.g., drug and alcohol abuse, developmental disabilities,
child welfare, correctional approaches, family services, care
of the aged, and others.  It is now possible to find social workers
whose training is quite specialized.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
</p>

<p>
In some states, social workers may practice with a bachelor's
degree; in many states, a master's degree is required.  In addition,
counselors are usually required to put in a substantial number
of hours of counseling under the supervision of a licensed
counselor.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
FEES
</p>

<p>
Social workers in private practice normally charge on an
hourly basis for their services, with sessions lasting thirty to fifty
minutes.  Rates vary considerably, in direct relation to other
health care costs.  Rates are higher in larger metropolitan areas
and also higher in New England and California than in the South
and Midwest.  An approximate range of $35 to $65 per counseling
session is normal at the time of this writing.
</p>

<p>
Costs for marriage and family counseling and for vocational
guidance counseling are similar to rates for individual counseling.
</p>

<p>
The charge for group therapy is frequently made for a block of
sessions.  The group therapist may, for example, recommend that
a group meet for ten sessions.  The resulting per-session cost is
normally significantly lower than is individual counseling.
(However, the goals of individual and group therapy are in general
different, as we will see; neither can automatically be substituted
for the other.)
</p>

<p>
Many social workers offer their services through a counseling
agency.  Some of these are privately run; others are funded by the
county or state.  Frequently, agencies charge for counseling
services based on a sliding scale, which takes into account the
financial situation of clients.  Sliding scale rates can be very
economical for lower-income individuals.  Bills for services in
some county and state agencies are made on a monthly basis;
individual counseling may cost only a few dollars per session for
individuals with restricted budgets.
</p>

<p>
There are many opportunities for clients to obtain economical
care, especially in metropolitan areas where counseling services
are widespread.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
DURATION OF TREATMENT
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to give any hard and fast rules as to how long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
counseling will take.  Obviously, much has to do with an individual's
objectives, the severity of the problem, and, frequently, how
long the problem has been neglected or ignored.  On the other
hand, much also has to do with the counselor's own orientation.
</p>

<p>
Today, many counselors receive training that emphasizes
"brief" therapy.  Specific goals of therapy are set, and it is
frequently possible to reach those goals within a matter of a few
months.  On the other hand, some counselors prefer, or have
been trained, to offer long-term individual psychotherapy.  Some
counselors have been influenced by the psychoanalytic approach,
which is usually of long duration, frequently requiring
one to several years.
</p>

<p>
There is no reason you, as a prospective client, should not ask
a counselor what kind of approach he or she uses and approximately
how long therapy can be expected to last.  You should not
hesitate to ask a counselor questions that reflect your concerns.
As you read further, this book will provide you with a frame of
reference so that you may evaluate more fully the answers a
counselor gives you.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
PSYCHOLOGISTS
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the last chapter, there are three kinds of
psychologists who are involved in different aspects of therapy:
clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, and
psychometrists.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
ORIENTATION AND TRAINING
</p>

<p>
<i>Clinical psychology</i> emphasizes the understanding, diagnosis,
and treatment of individuals in psychological distress.  Clinical
psychology is historically based on laboratory work that stressed
psychological assessment tests, and experimental and statistical analysis.
</p>

<p>
Clinical psychologists generally have a Ph.D. and complete a
lengthy internship in a clinical setting.  Most clinical
psychologists develop competence in both diagnostics and intervention.
The area of diagnostics includes individual interviews, psychological
testing, and personality assessment (psychological evaluation
to determine what a client's difficulties are).  Intervention
(the actual approach used to help a person) includes individual
psychotherapy, group therapy, and marriage and family therapy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
</p>

<p>
The objective of <i>counseling psychology</i> is to encourage
growth in the three major life areas of family, work, and education
and to prevent excessive psychological stress in them.  Like
clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists receive training
in individual, group, and marriage and family counseling as well
as in vocational counseling, assessment, and rehabilitation.
</p>

<p>
Often, you will find clinical psychologists in private practice,
while many counseling psychologists hold positions in organizations,
schools, and social service agencies.  Counseling psychologists
generally have a master's degree or Ph.D. and also are
required to complete internships in supervised counseling.
</p>

<p>
<i>Psychometrists</i> are specifically trained to give and to evaluate
psychological tests.  They are, so to speak, the "radiologists" of
the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.  Clients may be
referred to a psychometrist in order to take one or more
psychological tests; the psychometrist's interpretation of the
results is then forwarded to the client's therapist or counselor.
Increasingly, psychologists are being trained to do much of this
work themselves, so it has become less common to refer clients
to psychometrists unless an extensive amount of testing is
desired.
</p>

<p>
If you are advised to take one or more psychological tests, you
may be interested in knowing what to expect.  Many psychological
tests are multiple-choice.  You are given a printed list of
questions and an answer sheet.  There are no "right" answers.
You answer such questions as "Would you rather go to a party or
stay home and read a good book?"  Tests like this attempt to
provide insight into a client's outlook, personality, concerns,
values, and interests.  Some tests help to assess concentration,
coordination, and problem-solving ability.  Results of psychological
tests can be helpful to a counselor in deciding how best to
treat a client's problems.  Testing can be a great time- and
money-saver in therapy: the results of a twenty-minute test can give a
counselor information about a client that might otherwise be
gained only through a number of sessions.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
FEES
</p>

<p>
Because of their more advanced training, clinical psychologists
can be expected to charge fees that are somewhat higher
than what social workers in private practice receive.  Charges for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
the services of a clinical psychologist are made on an hourly
basis; counseling sessions usually last forty-five to fifty minutes,
although some psychologists will see clients for shorter periods.
</p>

<p>
Rates vary considerably according to geographical area.  An
approximate range of $50 to $80 per private session is normal at
this time.  Group session rates tend to be significantly lower.
</p>

<p>
If you consult a clinical or counseling psychologist who works
through an agency, you will often find that a sliding scale is used
to determine charges, as in social work.  If you have limited or no
health insurance, and financial concerns are a problem, you can
telephone counseling agencies in your area to ask whether a
sliding scale is used and, if so, what charges correspond to your
monthly income.  Later, we will look at how to locate counseling
agencies, as well as professionals in private practice.
</p>

<p>
Fees for psychological testing, whether through a psychologist
or a psychometrist, are usually billed on the basis of the tests
administered.  To give some idea, many tests cost $15 to $20 for
a psychologist to administer.  This charge is passed on to the
client.  The test results can sometimes be reviewed during a
counseling session so that no additional charge may be made for the
evaluation of the results.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
DURATION OF TREATMENT
</p>

<p>
Duration of treatment under a clinical or counseling psychologist
is similar to that of a social work counselor.  The best way
to proceed is to ask prospective therapists how long they believe
it will be necessary to see them.  Most professionals will be open
and candid; if the client's goals are specific and lend themselves
to "brief" therapy, a psychologist will make this clear.  And, as we
have already observed, much depends on the type of therapy
practiced by the psychologist.  Behavioral therapies tend to be of
shorter duration; psychoanalysis is longer-term.  In between
these there are, as we will see, many therapies that have different
emphases, methods, and goals.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
PSYCHIATRISTS
</p>

<p class="t3">
ORIENTATION AND TRAINING
</p>

<p>
Before they specialize in psychiatry, psychiatrists receive the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
training required of any physician.  After this, there is specialized
course work followed by a period of psychiatric internship.  The
educational background of psychiatrists enables them sometimes
to identify physical bases for emotional difficulties.  A later
chapter discusses this growing area of awareness.
</p>

<p>
Until fairly recently, the therapeutic training of psychiatrists
emphasized almost exclusively the approach of psychoanalysis.
Psychoanalysis developed within a medical context: Freud was a
physician, and his outlook was influenced by his medical orientation.
His approach was therefore felt to be the special province
of psychiatric medicine.  Eventually, as we have already noticed,
the methods of psychoanalysis came to be used by psychologists
and some social workers.  But for a long period, analysis was the
primary and exclusive focus of medical psychiatry.
</p>

<p>
The psychoanalytical orientation still dominates much psychiatry,
and many psychiatrists in private practice use psychoanalysis
as their therapy of choice.  However, there has been a general
broadening of the perspective of psychiatrists.  Other approaches
to psychotherapy are increasingly being used by psychiatrists.
Cognitive therapy is important among these; we will discuss its
purpose and methods later.
</p>

<p>
Psychiatrists are the only therapists who may prescribe
medication, and some of the most important recent advances in
psychiatry have come in this area.  Many emotional problems
appear to have a biochemical basis.  Many forms of anxiety, panic
disorders, and depression respond well to the growing family of
psychopharmaceutical drugs.  Other emotional difficulties,
including alcohol and drug abuse, can be moderated by
pharmaceutical therapy.
</p>

<p>
Psychiatrists, then, can be especially helpful in these ways:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to provide a medical evaluation for complaints that
sometimes have a physical basis
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to give assistance especially by means of psychoanalysis
and by means of an increasing number of alternative
therapies
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to help patients with medication to acquire a degree of
emotional equilibrium that will allow them to begin to
solve personal problems so that, in time, they may no
longer require medication
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
</p>

<p>
Although an M.D. may call herself or himself a psychiatrist, most psychiatrists
have had specialized advanced training in psychiatry.  Full
qualifications involve completion of a residency in psychiatry,
full membership in the American Psychiatric Association,
completion of a program of study at an institute of psychotherapy,
and board certification.  Many psychiatrists who practice are
eligible for board certification but simply have not yet taken the
national examinations that are required in order to be certified
by a national examining board.  Although apparently many of us
need to be reassured of this, you need not feel that there is
anything wrong or embarrassing about asking a prospective
psychiatrist, or his or her secretary, to describe the doctor's
background and training.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
FEES
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, the fees of psychiatrists in private
practice range approximately
from $75 up to $100 and occasionally more per session.
Private psychiatric assistance is therefore largely reserved for
the fairly well-to-do or for those who have health insurance with
substantial psychiatric benefits.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, psychiatric care is available through many
agencies; those that are run by counties and states normally have
sliding scales (some private agencies will also take an individual's
finances into account when setting fees).  Rates for consultation
with a psychiatrist at a public agency can be very reasonable
(as little as a few dollars per visit, depending on the patient's
income).  This makes the services of psychiatrists available to
those with modest or low incomes.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
DURATION OF TREATMENT
</p>

<p>
If a psychiatrist finds that an emotional problem has a physical
basis, or that it is due to biochemical depletion or imbalance in
the body, successful treatment may be relatively short,
sometimes a matter of a few months.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to enter psychoanalysis, then the duration of
treatment generally will be longer, often lasting a year and more;
during this time, psychoanalysts may expect you to come
for two or three sessions each week.
</p>

<p>
Shorter-term therapies, such as cognitive therapy, are&mdash;in part
because of the normal long duration required by
psychoanalysis&mdash;increasingly advocated
by psychiatrists.  Biofeedback and
relaxation training (see Chapter 5) are also among these
shorter-term approaches.  They may be effective within a
period of several months.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In this chapter, we have discussed the professions that make
up the mainstream of professional practice in counseling and
psychotherapy.  However, beyond the established and more
closely regulated professions of social worker, psychologist, and
psychiatrist, there are a number of other kinds of therapists who
offer services that are sufficiently different in nature that they
deserve to be treated in a separate chapter.  The next chapter
describes their contributions to therapy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span></p>

<p class="t2b">

<br />
  THE THERAPEUTIC JUNGLE,<br />
  PART II<br />
</p>

<p class="t3b">
Outside the Mainstream
</p>

<p>
Outside of any profession's frame of reference that defines what
problems it will handle and how, we usually find a group of
approaches that do not completely fit the established mold.  They
often can contribute creative and innovative ideas, and yet they
often lead to abuses in the name of novelty and experimentation.
And sometimes an older approach that fails to fit the newer
frame of reference is left behind, to keep company with more
radical approaches.
</p>

<p>
Just these things have happened in the practice of counseling
and psychotherapy, as we will see.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
RELIGIOUS COUNSELORS
</p>

<p>
The world's first professional counselors were religious.  Guidance
from priests, rabbis, and pastors has a long tradition.  The
tradition is such an old one, in fact, that going to talk to a
religious counselor has a respectability that the public has generally not
yet extended to other forms of counseling.
</p>

<p>
Many people with problems, even people with a religious
attitude or upbringing, tend to ignore the kind of help religious
counselors may be able to give.  This probably stems from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
belief that social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and some
other certified therapists whom we will discuss in a moment
have received special training in helping people with personal,
emotional problems, whereas religious advisors have not.
</p>

<p>
However, this is not universally true.  Many professional
religious representatives now <i>do</i> receive training in contemporary
therapies.  Increasingly, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish
educational institutions are incorporating course work and workshops
in modern counseling methods into programs of study for
priests, pastors, and rabbis.  Individuals who have been trained in
this way are easily located within a religious organization; a
telephone call to the organization should give you leads to
follow.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the widespread attempt many religious institutions
are making to remain up to date on contemporary approaches to
counseling, there is probably something also to be said for
traditional guidance.  All religious views seek to fulfill the needs
of men and women to find meaning in everyday life and to cope
effectively with life's hardships.  Contemporary approaches to
psychotherapy and counseling can offer much; their history,
however, is comparatively brief, extending over just the last
century.  For many people&mdash;depending on their inclinations,
values, and sympathies&mdash;traditional religious guidance may provide
much that is as yet not to be found in the more scientific and
systematic schools of contemporary therapy.
</p>

<p>
If you decide to go to a religious professional for counseling,
you will probably find the process relatively informal and
friendly.  Also, religious professionals generally expect that their
private counseling services will not be remunerated; contributions
to the supporting religious organization are of course
hoped for but are often not required in exchange for guidance.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the authorized community of social workers,
psychologists, and psychiatrists, it can be more difficult to locate
a religious professional who <i>specializes</i> in a particular approach
to counseling.  The background in modern approaches to counseling
that religious professionals tend to receive is "eclectic."  They
normally receive training in a variety of approaches; their
programs of study are based on the belief that flexibility in
counseling is essential, that nothing works well for everyone.
This openness can be of value to many people.  But, as you read
this book, you may decide to locate a therapist who has a certain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
specific orientation.  He or she may be a religious counselor, a
psychologist, or another qualified professional.  In general, if you
have a specific form of therapy in mind, you will have to ask a
prospective therapist whether he or she has the training to give
you the kind of help you are looking for.  This is especially true
of religious counselors.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
BIOFEEDBACK THERAPISTS
</p>

<p>
Biofeedback is a newcomer to the therapeutic world that has
grown tremendously in popularity in the last ten years or so.
Biofeedback therapy gradually enables individuals to become
aware of certain physical changes in their bodies.  These physical
changes are detected by means of sensitive measuring instruments
that give information back to clients so they can learn to
control a particular physical response.
</p>

<p>
Biofeedback is used by therapists who have been specially
trained in its use, as well as by some licensed psychologists,
psychiatrists, social workers, physical therapists, speech
pathologists, and even some dentists.  Some psychiatrists now work
jointly with a biofeedback therapist: the psychiatrist can
prescribe medication and provide psychotherapy or analysis, while
the associated biofeedback therapist can teach patients how to
lessen their responses to pain and stress-related problems.
</p>

<p>
The Biofeedback Society of America is an interdisciplinary
group of healthcare professionals; it is presently developing
training standards and guidelines for certification of
biofeedback practitioners.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
RELAXATION, HYPNOSIS, AND MEDITATION THERAPISTS
</p>

<p>
Relaxation training, hypnosis, and meditation all seek to bring
about a deep sense of relaxation in a person.  We will examine
each in greater detail later; a short overview of these approaches is given here.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
RELAXATION TRAINING
</p>

<p>
Relaxation training involves exercises that enable a person to
learn to induce <i>at will</i> a state of physical and mental calm.
Relaxation training is a practical skill&mdash;it can be very effective
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
and useful in coping with stressful situations.  Like any learned
skill, control comes only with practice, usually over a period of
several months.  Many social workers and psychologists teach
clients relaxation techniques.  Certification standards
specifically for relaxation training have not been established.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
HYPNOSIS
</p>

<p>
Hypnosis involves two stages: (1) progressive, deep relaxation
to a point at which an individual is in a peaceful, trancelike state,
still self-aware but profoundly relaxed; and (2) suggestion,
which persuades the person to adopt certain future attitudes,
thoughts, or behavior.
</p>

<p>
Hypnosis, like relaxation training, can be learned.  Most people
treated by means of hypnosis steadily improve in their ability to
be hypnotized so that they can more effectively allow themselves
to be influenced by means of carefully planned suggestions.
Many psychologists and psychiatrists make use of hypnosis in the
context of therapy; some practitioners treat patients exclusively
by means of hypnosis.
</p>

<p>
The certification of therapists trained in hypnosis is still
unsettled in many states, where anyone can hang out a shingle.
Since many licensed psychologists and psychiatrists and some
certified social workers <i>do</i> receive professional training in
hypnosis, these are the professions to which it is most reliable to
go for hypnotherapy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
MEDITATION
</p>

<p>
Meditation is still a "fringe" therapy.  Techniques of meditation
tend seldom to be taught to clients in psychotherapy, although there is
a growing body of evidence that meditation is able to bring about
great resistance to stress, an increased sense of inner calm, and
even actual changes in brain-wave patterns associated with deep
relaxation.  These effects of meditation are now being studied,
with encouraging results.
</p>

<p>
The practice of meditation is, in the author's view, at present
best learned on one's own, although some commercial organizations
provide instruction.  A later chapter discusses approaches
to meditation and suggests some of the ways meditation can be of
value.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3b">
  HOLISTIC THERAPIES:<br />
  BIOENERGETICS, YOGA, AND EXERCISE<br />
</p>

<p>
Holism views man as a unity of body and mind.  The established
approaches to therapy and counseling, represented by social
workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and to a certain extent by
some religious professionals, all focus attention on our
mental-psychological dimension.  Similarly, biofeedback, hypnosis, and
meditation emphasize the central role of <i>mental</i> control.
</p>

<p>
Holistic approaches, on the other hand, attempt to bring about
positive change by means of emphasis on physical factors that are
believed to have a close connection to mental processes.
Although holism sees human beings as integral organisms, holistic
approaches are inclined to have this physical focus.
</p>

<p>
Holistic therapies, like meditation, are "fringe" therapies.  They
are not generally employed by members of the "authorized"
community of health practitioners, for two reasons: First, a kind
of professional respectability and elitism have come to be
associated with the psychological approach; social work,
psychology, and psychiatry have an established place in institutions of
higher learning, whereas fringe therapies do not.  Second, since
physicians treat the body, there is an institutionalized prejudice
against nonmedical treatment that has the same focus.
</p>

<p>
Chiropractic has encountered this problem, as have other
forms of holism, such as bioenergetics, yoga, diet therapy, and
rolfing.
</p>

<p>
Although much of value may be offered by these fringe
therapies, they have also resulted in abuse to consumers.
Because of a general absence of licensing standards and of scientific
credibility, people frequently are drawn in by the sometimes
extravagant promises of unscrupulous or overly enthusiastic
fringe therapists.  In this area, as in all others that affect the
consumer, the proper attitude is one of healthy skepticism and
restraint.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BIOENERGETICS
</p>

<p>
Of these holistic therapies, bioenergetics is perhaps considered
the most respectable because it <i>is</i> used by some psychologists.
Bioenergetics attempts to diminish an individual's psychological
defenses by means of sequences of specially designed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
physical exercises that, in a controlled and deliberate way, stress
the person physically.  Practitioners of bioenergetics believe that
physical exercises of this kind rapidly put a person in touch with
buried (repressed) feelings and speed up the process of inner
integration that all holistic practices, as well as traditional
therapy, wish to achieve.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
YOGA
</p>

<p>
Yoga exists in various forms.  The two main varieties are hatha
yoga and raja yoga.  Hatha yoga emphasizes physical flexibility;
raja yoga teaches breathing techniques and meditation.  Hatha
yoga, because of its focus on the body, belongs to the family of
approaches we are considering here.
</p>

<p>
Hatha yoga practitioners believe that the physical flexibility
and control that are acquired through an extended period of
physical training in yoga exercise tend to influence your mental
orientation.  You become, in this view, more flexible, less rigid,
less defensive, less subject to stress, more open, responsive,
alert, and capable of warmth in human relationships.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
EXERCISE THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Counselors and therapists are starting to take very seriously
the idea that exercise brings emotional benefits.  Exercise
therapy, more so than other physically based approaches discussed in
this chapter, has been tested in various ways.  Many emotional
conditions&mdash;for example, anxiety and depression&mdash;seem to be
significantly reduced thanks to periods of sustained vigorous
exercise.  Tolerance to stress and to pain appears to be increased.
Physical exercise can be an outlet for pent-up hostility and
aggression that, according to many theorists, may be turned
inward, then fester, and eventually take the form of a variety of
psychological disorders.  Furthermore, vigorous, sustained
aerobic exercise&mdash;like running or swimming&mdash;appears to have a
calming effect as a result of certain chemical compounds that
are released into the bloodstream.  We will look at some of the
interesting recent studies of the therapeutic value of exercise
later on.

<br />
WHERE YOU CAN FIND HELP
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
PRIVATE PRACTICE
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, social work counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists,
biofeedback therapists, hypnotherapists, and other therapists
may all offer their services through private practice.  In
general, there can be definite advantages to counseling in the
setting of a therapist's private practice.  You are given a degree of
personal care that, as an individual paying customer, you are less
likely to receive in counseling provided by agencies.  You become
part of a therapist's own practice, so it is natural for him or her
to devote special attention to you.  Therapists are likely to be
more personally involved in their private practice and in the
quality of care they try to give their private clients than it is
possible or even personally desirable for them to be when they
work by the hour for an agency.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, private sessions with a therapist tend to be
considerably more expensive than counseling can be through
many agencies.  You ought not to take too seriously general
comparisons between therapy as you may encounter it privately
and therapy in the setting of an agency.  You can often find a
counselor who is congenial, interested, attentive, and skilled;
whose services will be easier for you to bear financially; and who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
offers his or her services through an agency.  If finances are
restrictive for you, you should look into agency-sponsored
counseling.
</p>

<p>
Many social work counselors, psychologists, and some psychiatrists
who maintain private practices intended mainly for individual
therapy also offer group therapy.  Often, a therapist will
observe that a number of individual clients share certain
problems and experiences, and he or she will suggest that these
people meet together as a group.  The per-session price can be
expected to be a good deal lower than for individual sessions;
the rate usually reflects the number of people who meet in the
group and the length of time the group is expected to continue.
</p>

<p>
Some social workers and some psychologists <i>specialize</i> in
group therapy.  Groups are formed periodically, run a set number
of weeks, and may or may not bring together individuals with
common problems.  Some group therapists believe that diversity
in a counseling group is valuable: in such a group, you might find
one person combating alcoholism, another trying to cope with
loneliness and grief after the death of a spouse, someone trying
to break out of the confines of shyness, a person suffering from
public speaking anxiety, someone wanting to change careers but
who is blocked by fear, and others.  An exchange of views among
participants with diverse backgrounds can frequently encourage
growth in the group members.
</p>

<p>
Most counseling agencies also offer group therapy, as do many
hospitals and schools.  We will take a look at each of these
settings in turn.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
COUNTY, STATE, AND PRIVATE AGENCIES
</p>

<p>
Individual, marriage and family, and group counseling are all
offered by many counseling agencies.
</p>

<p>
County and state agencies receive public funding and usually
have sliding scales for the rates they charge.  Often, one or more
psychiatrists work in association with counselors, who may be
social workers or psychologists.  If you go to a county or state
agency, you will probably be interviewed initially by a receptionist
or nurse.  You will be asked questions about your financial
situation and health insurance coverage, if you have any, and you
will be asked to agree to a proposed rate for the services of the
agency.  Some county and state agencies make a monthly charge
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
for their services; you may consult regularly with members of the
staff, counselors and/or psychiatrists, in accordance with your
individual needs.
</p>

<p>
Private counseling agencies function in a similar way.  Their
services tend to be more expensive because they do not receive
public financial support, as do county and state agencies.
</p>

<p>
Many health insurance plans that provide psychological benefits
can be used to pay for the services of a private or a public
counseling agency.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
HOSPITALS AND OTHER INPATIENT SERVICES
</p>

<p>
Individuals with severe problems who need complete care can
enter private, county, or state hospitals that offer psychiatric
services.  A separate chapter discusses pros and cons of the
sometimes frightening alternative of hospitalization.
</p>

<p>
Again, publicly funded hospitals tend to charge on the basis
of a sliding scale, which takes a person's financial situation into
account.  Where financial concerns are not pressing, private
hospitals in general tend to offer a greater degree of individual
attention and higher quality of care and physical facilities.
</p>

<p>
In addition to hospital facilities, many metropolitan areas have
established organizations to provide counseling services on an
inpatient basis.  Some are private; some are public.  They offer an
alternative to hospitalization.  They tend to be more informal and
open and are managed by their own staffs of professional
counselors and psychiatrists.  These residential care facilities
usually are intended for stays of from one to several weeks.  They
have a variety of counseling programs, ranging from individual
therapy to group counseling and vocational guidance.
</p>

<p>
One way to locate such an inpatient organization is to
telephone a crisis intervention (sometimes called <i>suicide
prevention</i>) number likely to be listed at the beginning of your
telephone directory.  A volunteer probably will answer your call
and should be able to direct you to inpatient facilities available
in your area.

<p class="t3b">
ACADEMIC SOURCES OF COUNSELING
</p>

<p>
Counseling is one of the services available to full- and part-time
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
students who are enrolled in junior or four-year colleges
and graduate schools.  Many educational institutions offer
individual counseling, normally by counseling psychologists, and all
colleges offer academic advising in the context of a certain
amount of vocational guidance.
</p>

<p>
Colleges with programs in counseling and psychology usually
also offer certain classes with a practical, problem-solving focus.
Although they may not be specifically intended to help individual
students with life problems, this is in fact what they frequently
end up doing.  It is inevitable for students in a practically
oriented counseling class to apply much that they learn to their
own problems.  Many class meetings of this kind tend to be
almost indistinguishable from group therapy sessions: students
receive guidance from a professionally trained instructor,
exchange views, and express personal concerns.  You might think of
college classes with a practical, psychological emphasis
especially if you are drawn to therapy as an opportunity for general
personal growth.
</p>

<p>
Classes of this kind may be offered in a college's regular
programs, which are sometimes open only to students working
toward a degree.  Other similar opportunities, however, are
available through many continuing education, or adult education,
programs.  Many secondary school districts offer practical,
psychologically-focused classes for adults who do not choose to
enter a degree program.  This is also true of community, state,
and many private colleges.
</p>

<p>
Colleges and private professionals offer intensive workshops
with a variety of counseling emphases.  Two-day weekend
workshops have become especially popular.  Topics range from
alcoholism, drug abuse, child-rearing problems, and separation and
divorce to illness and chronic pain, marital concerns, depression,
stress control, and so on.  Newspapers announce counseling
workshops; you will often find notices about them posted in
public and college libraries.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
SOME REFLECTIONS ON WHERE YOU<br />
GO FOR COUNSELING
</p>

<p>
You should bear in mind that where you go for counseling or
therapy is nothing more than an address.  What is important is
what happens in your relationship with your counselor or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
therapist.  If you have found a therapist whom you respect and
feel motivated to work with, it makes little difference, as far as
the benefits you obtain from therapy are concerned, whether
your therapist works in private practice or offers his or her
services through an agency, school, hospital, or residential
facility.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, where you go for counseling <i>will</i> greatly
determine the price you will pay for services and frequently
whether health insurance will cover your expenses.  To some
extent, where you go can sometimes, as we have noted, influence
the quality of care and individual attention you receive.  But this
is a generalization; you frequently will be able to locate excellent
care through less expensive facilities.  This will depend to
some extent on luck, but more on the amount of effort you put
into locating the kind of help you may need.
</p>

<p>
Since you are reading this book, you already have initiative like
this: you have the ability to influence what kind and quality of
therapy you will receive.  For you, it will be less a matter of pure
luck than it is for people who choose a therapy and therapist
arbitrarily.

SELF-DIAGNOSIS
<br />
Mapping Your Way to a Therapy
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This chapter is central to your use of this book as a guide.  There
are two main ways to use this book to help you to choose a
therapy:
</p>

<p>
1. You can familiarize yourself with all of the major
approaches to therapy, weigh their advantages and disadvantages in
relation to your needs, and then make a choice.  Twenty-six
approaches to therapy are discussed and evaluated in this book,
so keeping your judgments of their pros and cons clearly in mind
can be challenging.  Although comprehensive understanding has
a value of its own, it may not be essential to you.
</p>

<p>
2. You may prefer to go through three simple steps to narrow
the alternatives down to a small number of therapies that have
been most successful for specific goals, problems, and personal
attributes that most closely approximate your own.  This is a less
time-consuming process, and it will take into account
professional evaluations of the different therapies.
</p>

<p>
In either case, your informed judgment will be the basis for
your eventual choice.  This chapter is intended to help you if you
prefer the second route&mdash;to narrow down the alternatives in a
clear and logical way.  If you prefer, however, to become
acquainted with all of the major therapies discussed in this book,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
you might skim through sections of this chapter to give you a
framework for more efficient understanding.
</p>

<p>
The information in this chapter relates to many different sets
of goals, problems, and kinds of people.  Not all of this
information will be relevant to you, so you will find instructions to
direct you to specific recommendations that take into account
your own needs and interests.
</p>

<p>
This chapter is where practical and prudent planning can
begin.  In fact, this book represents the first attempt to match
you, your personal qualities, and your goals with the most
effective therapy or therapies available to you.
</p>

<p>
Even though nearly all of the main approaches to counseling
and therapy are creations of the past century, it may seem
surprising that no unified effort has been made to identify what
specific kinds of problems each approach is especially useful for
treating and for what types of clients.  In this respect, the field of
medicine is much better developed.  The discipline of medical
diagnostics is now on the verge of becoming scientific, and it is
now possible to identify for many conditions and in individual
cases very concrete and well-defined treatment procedures that
are likely to be effective.  This has not been true in the field of
psychology: most research efforts have so far gone into formulating
definitions of the various mental and emotional disorders.
But the important work, from the prospective client's point of
view, had yet to be done: to make it possible for him to know&mdash;in
relation to his individual problems, goals, interests, abilities,
and temperament&mdash;which approaches to therapy are likely to
help him the most.
</p>

<p>
If you are in serious emotional pain, waiting until all of the
research results are in is just not possible; you need help <i>now</i>.  In
spite of incomplete knowledge in psychotherapy, a large body of
information has come from studies of the effectiveness of therapies
for different problems and for different kinds of people.  But
until now this information existed only in fragmented form and
was familiar only to professional psychologists.  Enough data
are in to begin to draw reasonable guidelines for individuals who
seek psychological help.
</p>

<p>
The mapping process described in this chapter is the result of
assembling and then organizing large quantities of data from
many sources.  It was then necessary to design an easily followed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
step-by-step approach to enable you to narrow down the many
therapeutic alternatives to a small number that, through your
efforts and the assistance of a therapist, can be of help to you.
Guidelines of this kind are never static; they will change to some
extent as time and knowledge advance.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
OBSTACLES TO FINDING A THERAPY THAT FITS YOU
</p>

<p>
There are real obstacles to efficient treatment in psychotherapy.
They cost people much time, energy, hope, and money as
they try to find appropriate help.  Psychotherapy is not yet a
systematic field.
</p>

<p>
There are three main reasons why it is so difficult to find
approaches to therapy that will fit individual clients and their
needs:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Emotional and mental difficulties vary tremendously.
Psychologists and psychiatrists are still in the process of
classifying the kinds of emotional and mental problems
people have.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* People are individuals.  Their personalities, likes and
dislikes, and motivations for entering therapy differ greatly.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists, too, are individuals.  Their personalities,
interests, values, and motivations for <i>offering</i> therapy
differ greatly.  Their professional training and preferences
in favor of one or several approaches to therapy also vary
significantly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As a result, what works for one patient will not necessarily
work for another.  <i>What</i> helps and <i>who</i> helps in one person's
situation may not help in another's.  Yet all three of the factors on
which effective treatment depends&mdash;a patient's goals and
problems, his or her personality traits, and the approach of the
therapist&mdash;in many cases <i>can</i> be matched intelligently.  You, as a
prospective client, know a great deal about yourself; it doesn't
make sense to choose arbitrarily among the many therapies.  It
takes very little time to map your way: in the process, you will
learn more about yourself, what to anticipate in therapy, and in
what direction to start.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span></p>

<p>
REALISM: A GOOD BEGINNING
</p>

<p>
In order to identify one or more therapies that may be most
promising in relation to <i>your</i> goals, <i>your</i> problems, and <i>the kind
of person you understand yourself to be</i>, you must begin your
search with a good measure of realism.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SETTING GOALS
</p>

<p>
It can be very difficult for anyone who is seriously troubled to
think clearly and use good judgment.  You may find it hard,
perhaps impossible, at this time to identify your goals.  You may
feel confused, anxious, depressed, and not know why you feel
that way.  Even so, you will find as you read on that you can set
important goals for yourself.
</p>

<p>
If you are at a loss and have no sense of purpose, <i>that</i> fact gives
you a goal to work toward in therapy: to develop clearly thought-out
goals.  Though you may not know what precipitated your
feelings of confusion, anxiety, or depression, you at least <i>know</i>
that you feel confused, anxious, or depressed, and you will find
recommendations in this chapter on how to find appropriate
help for your suffering.  Do not judge yourself harshly if you lack
a sense of direction or if you are troubled but do not know why.
Just keep reading.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
OPENING YOURSELF TO CHANGE
</p>

<p>
There is a second thing you should be realistic about when
you do know what you want and what your problems are.  Our
experiences and what we learn about ourselves <i>change</i> us.  If you
enter therapy based on your present perceptions of yourself, it is
likely that these are going to change to some extent as a result of
your experiences in therapy.  Does that mean that you cannot
plan or select a therapy intelligently?  Clearly, it doesn't.
<i>Everyone has to start where he or she is</i>.  There is no other choice.  But
you should try to persuade yourself to be open to changes in
your views and feelings.  If you feel rigid about your own
perceptions of yourself, it is just possible that your rigidity may
be contributing to the problems you want to resolve.  As in any
attempt to learn or to change, it is important periodically to
reevaluate your needs, values, and the results you may have
achieved so far.  If you select a therapy using the structured
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
approach in this chapter, you may decide to retrace your
footsteps a few months in the future.  You may find that you
would take a different path in the light of what you then see.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BEING HONEST ABOUT YOURSELF
</p>

<p>
There is a third piece of realism that I would like you to
consider, and this is <i>very</i> hard for anyone to take to heart.  If you
can, you are a very unusual person.  Answering the following
questions honestly takes some real courage.  But you must ask
yourself: "To what extent do I <i>need</i> my present symptoms?  Is it
useful to me <i>not</i> to have a sense of direction?  Am I somehow
<i>benefiting</i> from feeling depressed?  Is my anxiety <i>helpful</i> to me in
some way?"
</p>

<p>
You may think these suggestions are no more than contrived
and unkind psychologizing.  After all, who <i>chooses</i> to suffer?
Does anyone <i>want</i> to wake up at 4:00 A.M. shaking and crying?
Yet, again and again, therapists who care very much about their
patients find that many of them "cling to their symptoms with
the desperation of a drowning man hanging onto a raft."[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] Lewis R. Wolberg, <i>Hypnosis</i>
(New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1972),
p. 238.  (In this guide, see Chapter 15, on hypnosis.)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For diverse reasons, many people&mdash;even people who are
suffering greatly&mdash;do not <i>want</i> to change.  Their unhappiness,
pain, and confusion can serve numerous functions.  You may not
believe this right now, but from time to time as you read this
book, and later in your life, this question may occur to you, if
only for a moment: "How may this unresolved problem benefit me?"
</p>

<p>
The plain truth is that even suffering can confer benefits on us.
This is at the root of much of the tragedy of emotional problems
that prove to be resistant to treatment.  The distressed, despondent,
overwrought, and trembling person seated before the
therapist may have found a way to gain the attention he was
unable to get otherwise.  Or perhaps his suffering is a way to
lighten a burden of guilt that eventually caused an inner
collapse.  There are many "benefits," many very good reasons to
want <i>not</i> to change but to try <i>anyway</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, before you begin to seek a specific type of therapy, try to
be realistic and keep these thoughts in mind:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
</p>

<p class="point">
1. Specifying clear-cut goals and understanding why you feel
troubled are not essential now.  Certainly it will be helpful
if you can translate vague complaints into concrete
problems, to help both your own understanding and eventually
your therapist's.  The more specific you can be about what is
troubling you, what situations especially distress you, and
what has motivated you to come to therapy, the easier it will
be for you to find help and for the therapist you choose to
help you.  But in times of crisis, clarity can be very hard to
gain, so be patient.
</p>

<p class="point">
2. If you do have clear-cut goals and a good understanding of
yourself now, use these to plan how to proceed, remembering
that openness to change will profit you and that, in all
likelihood, your initial perceptions of yourself will change
as you become involved in therapy.
</p>

<p class="point">
3. You may, at least now, need your symptoms, however
painful they may be.  How successful therapy will be for you
may have a great deal to do with your willingness to let go
of the possible benefits of being troubled, in pain, or disabled.
</p>

<p class="point">
4. Resist digging ruts for yourself.  Try to refrain from locking
into a particular course of action until you have given
yourself time to consider alternatives.  Once you have
chosen a direction, if after a reasonable time the therapy
and the therapist you have selected do not seem to be
helping you, it is essential to try another approach.  This is
especially difficult once you have invested your time,
energy, and money and perhaps have developed a good
relationship with your therapist.  You may like him or her,
feel comfortable and comforted, but if you are not gaining
what you want, you have to stop and try again.
</p>

<p class="point">
5. Finally, have a thorough physical examination before
entering therapy, if you have not had one recently.  Be
truthful and open with your physician.  Some emotional and
mental problems are produced by underlying physical
conditions, many of which can be treated effectively (see
Chapter 8).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
HOW TO MAP YOUR WAY TO A THERAPY
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this chapter presents a three-step process
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
for choosing an approach to therapy that is potentially
best-suited to your personal needs and personality.
</p>

<p>
In the first step, you become familiar with the main kinds of
goals and problems that motivate people to enter therapy.  You
check those that seem to be most relevant to you and then try to
confirm the accuracy of your choices.  This will point you in the
direction of one or more promising therapies.
</p>

<p>
In the second step, you consider a list of the main personality
traits that are relevant to your choice of therapy.  Again, you
check those that seem most to apply to you and then confirm
your self-understanding.  Step 2 will also direct you to one or
more therapies.
</p>

<p>
In the third step, you use your results from Step 1 and Step 2
to select an approach to therapy that most closely matches your
needs, interests, and personality.
</p>

<p>
Let's begin.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
STEP 1.  DIAGNOSING YOUR PROBLEMS AND SETTING YOUR<br />
GOALS: IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE THERAPIES
</p>

<p class="point">
a. Read through Table 1 (pages 67-69).
</p>

<p class="point">
b. Check the goals or problems most applicable to you.  If you
are in doubt, refer to the numbered short descriptions in
the section "Matching Your Goals and Problems with Most
Promising Therapies" following Table 1.
</p>

<p class="point">
c. Choose one or two goals or problems that are the most
important to you.
</p>

<p class="point">
d. Confirm your choices: Refer to the section "Matching Your Goals
and Problems with Most Promising Therapies" that follows Table
1. In that section, read the corresponding short descriptions of
the one or two goals or
problems you checked in Table 1 and ask yourself whether, in fact,
these accurately apply to you. For example, if you checked Â§7 in
Table 1, then read the corresponding Â§7 in "Matching Your Goals
and Problems with Most Promising Therapies."
</p>

<p class="point">
e. If, after doing this, you continue to believe that the goals or
problems you checked relate to you, make a record of the
therapy letter codes given at the end of each description.
You will find that occasionally letter codes are divided into
two groups: those judged to be generally more effective
(called "primary"), and a set of alternatives ("secondary").
Now go directly to Step 2.  On the other hand, if you
come to feel that the goals or problems you checked really
do <i>not</i> apply to you, go back to Table 1 and consider other
alternatives.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
STEP 2. SELF-UNDERSTANDING:<br />
IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE THERAPIES
</p>

<p class="point">
a. Read through Table 2 (page 79).
</p>

<p class="point">
b. Check the personal qualities that seem best to describe you.
</p>

<p class="point">
c. Choose one or two of these that are the most significant to
you.
</p>

<p class="point">
d. Confirm your self-understanding: Refer to the section
"Matching Your Personality with the Most Promising Therapies"
following Table 2.  Read the short descriptions of the one or
two personal qualities you checked and respond to the
questions you will find there.
</p>

<p class="point">
e. If, after doing this, you believe that the personal qualities
you checked in Table 2 do, in fact, describe you accurately, make a
record of the therapy letter codes given at the end of the
questions.  Now go directly to Step 3.  If, on the other hand,
judging from your responses to the questions you
answered, you do <i>not</i> feel that the personal qualities you
checked are true of you, return to Table 2 and consider
other alternatives.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
STEP 3. CHOOSING A THERAPY
</p>

<p class="point">
a. Compare the two sets of letter codes you recorded as a
result of Steps 1 and 2.  If one or more letter codes are
common to both sets, make a special note of the common
code(s); otherwise, group the letter codes together.
</p>

<p class="point">
b. Refer to Table 3 (pages 86-87), which summarizes the
letter codes of all the therapies discussed in this guide.
Check the code(s) you just listed.
</p>

<p class="point">
c. If you feel that you have taken your time, have been
thoughtful about yourself, and now feel reasonably
confident about the tentative conclusions you have reached,
turn to the chapter(s) in this book that discuss the
approaches to therapy you checked.  As you read these, try to
imagine yourself as a client in each of the therapy situations
described.  Which approach seems most appropriate given
your goals or problems?  Do you feel that <i>you</i> have the
personal traits that the therapy is most suited for?  If so, give
that approach to therapy a reasonable trial period.  If not,
consider other alternatives you checked.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
AN EXAMPLE OF FOLLOWING STEPS 1, 2, AND 3
</p>

<p>
Suppose you check Â§3.1, shyness passivity, in Table 1.  You
refer to the section following Table 1, relating to personality
trait problems.  You feel that shyness <i>is</i> something that interferes
significantly with your life, interests, and desires, and you want
to do something to overcome it.  Therapies Q, C, N, and D are
recommended to you as potentially useful.  Then, in Table 2, you
check Â§7.  You refer to Â§7 following Table 2, and you decide that
you especially need to work on pent-up feelings in need of
release.  Therapies C and J are suggested there as potentially
appropriate for you.
</p>

<p>
You now have two sets of therapy letter codes to consider: Q,
C, N, and D; and C and J.
</p>

<p>
Therapy C is common to both recommended groups of therapies,
but you are interested in comparing the other therapies
with C.  In addition to reading about C, you decide to read the
discussions of therapies D, J, N, and Q.  From Table 3, the five
letter codes C, D, J, N, and Q denote Gestalt therapy, transactional
analysis, bioenergetics, counter-conditioning, and group
therapy, respectively.  After reading about these therapies, you
come to feel that Gestalt therapy probably would challenge you
in especially needed ways, so you decide to locate a therapist
with training in Gestalt therapy.  (For information on locating a
therapist, see Chapter 17.)

MATCHING YOUR GOALS AND PROBLEMS WITH MOST<br />
PROMISING THERAPIES
</p>

<p class="check">
Â§<i>1 Personal Development Goals</i>
</p>

<p>
These may involve either (Â§1.1) <i>adding</i> new skills or qualities
or (Â§1.2) <i>subtracting</i> habits or undesirable traits.
</p>

<p class="check">
Â§1.1.  There are basically two different approaches to
achieving the first goal:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* You identify a specific skill or personality trait you would
like to develop&mdash;see Table 1, Â§3.  For example, you may
want to develop a stronger success-identity (Â§3.9),
improve your communication skills (Â§3.6), gain a stronger
sense of life's purpose (Â§3.8), or become more assertive
(i.e., overcome a degree of shyness, Â§3.1).  For references
to recommended therapies for these goals, see Â§3 below.
For vocational counseling and therapy: H, I, M
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Alternatively, you decide to approach self-development
with a desire for <i>broad-spectrum</i> improvements.  Therapies
with this orientation are not especially concerned
with highly specific behaviors or problems but attempt to
treat the whole person so that self-esteem is gradually
increased, as are a sense of satisfaction in daily living,
enjoyment of others, and a feeling of being at ease with
them.

Â§<i>4 Neuroses</i>
</p>

<p>
A person is said to suffer from a neurosis if he or she has
exaggerated emotional responses or ideas of reality that blow
things out of proportion.  Individuals with neuroses are able to
communicate normally or with mild emotional interference.
Their emotional problems interfere with normal living but do
not impair them so that their lives are clearly out of control (as
in psychoses, alcoholism, drug addiction, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Â§4.1.  Anxiety disorders, panic disorders, post-traumatic
stress disorders, etc.:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Anxiety and panic attacks</i> are characterized by feelings of
fear, dread, and tension.  You may have a sense of imminent
disaster or death, a feeling of helplessness often followed by
depression.  (These are also symptoms of <i>chronic anxiety</i>.)
Other symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks include dizziness,
dry mouth, sweating, headaches, heart palpitations, increased
blood pressure, rapid breathing, weakness, insomnia, increased
urination, a feeling of unreality, diminished concentration,
memory difficulties, indecision, obsessive thinking about anxiety
symptoms, second-order anxiety (anxiety that you are or will be
anxious), and desperation to obtain relief.
</p>

<p class="subcheck">
Primary:  Y, H, F, V, T, W, X<br />
Secondary:  H, K, U
</p>

<p>
<i>Post-traumatic stress disorders</i> are frequently misdiagnosed
as anxiety disorders.  Patients suffering from post-traumatic
stress have been exposed to situations of great stress&mdash;e.g.,
battlefront conditions, rape, imprisonment in a concentration
camp.  These situations are perceived as inescapable, and they
leave long-lasting emotional scars.  Symptoms include reactions
delayed until days or months have passed since the trauma
situation, emotional numbing, chronic anxiety, restlessness,
irritability, recurrent nightmares, increased startle responses,
impulsive behavior, and depression.
</p>

<p class="subcheck">
Primary:  Y, in conjunction with therapies
recommended for anxiety and panic attacks.
</p>

<p>
Â§4.2.  Phobias: Phobias are fears that are disproportionate to
the threat of a situation.  They are involuntary and cannot be
reasoned away.  They lead to avoidance of the feared situation.
</p>

<p class="subcheck">
Primary:  N, L, Y, W, V<br />
Secondary:  U, A, K, D
</p>

<p class="check">
For fears of public speaking, especially:  E
</p>

<p>
Â§4.3.  Compulsions: People with neurotic compulsions engage
in repetitive rituals that give them temporary relief from anxiety.
Compulsive behaviors are often motivated by a desire for exactness
and perfection&mdash;for example, compulsive hygiene, washing,
counting, praying, reflecting about yourself, repetitive isolated
thoughts, preoccupation with trifling details, etc.
</p>

<p class="subcheck">
Primary:  E, M, O, A<br />
Secondary:  Y, T, K
</p>

<p>
Compulsions that arise, or may be resolved, in relation to your
family:  S
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>

<p>
Â§4.4.  NoÃ¶genic neuroses: A person can be emotionally disabled
by serious conflicts between opposing personal, ethical, or
religious values.  This problem has not gained widespread
recognition among psychiatrists and therapists.  It is a focus
of logotherapy (see Chapter 11):  G
</p>

<p>
Â§4.5.  Psychosomatic disorders, hypochondria: Physical
disorders caused by emotional problems are psychosomatic.
Examples include some cases of colitis, stomach cramps, diarrhea,
constipation, ulcers, cardiac arrhythmias, impotence, back and
neck spasms, and migraines.  Hypochondria involves an exaggerated
concern over potential and imagined symptoms of disease.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>5 Mood Disturbances (Affective Disorders)</i>
</p>

<p>
There are three primary mood disorders: depression, mania,
and manic depression.  They may be neurotic, or they may be
psychotic, in which you experience hallucinations, delusions,
and withdrawal from reality.  Each disorder may be situational or
nonsituational, depending on the role of precipitating events,
such as the death of a loved one, loss of a job, diagnosis of
terminal illness, etc.  Situational mood disorders usually
disappear with time.  All three disorders may appear as isolated
episodes, or they may be recurrent.
</p>

<p>
Â§5.1.  Depression: Clinical depression is not simple sadness or
grief.  Severely depressed people speak slowly, laboriously.  It is
difficult for you to maintain attention and concentration.  You
may have feelings of hopelessness, despair, heaviness, self-blame,
heightened self-criticism, great pessimism about the future,
inability to make decisions, tendencies to think of suicide and
sometimes to commit it.  Dependence on loved ones increases as
you feel helpless.  Interests diminish in work, hobbies, and
friends.  You may cry frequently; you may be irritable and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
inclined to have angry outbursts.  You probably sleep poorly and
awaken frequently, particularly in early morning.  Anxiety is
common in about 50 percent of patients.  There is frequently
little appetite for food or for sex:  Y, E, P, U, T, W, X
</p>

<p>
As a sense of deep discouragement with life:  H
</p>

<p>
Depressed as a result of a conflict in personal values:  G
</p>

<p>
If you are willing to work on your problems within a wider
focus (also see Â§1.1):  A
</p>

<p>
Â§5.2.  Mania: You tend to have exaggerated beliefs in your
capabilities; you tend to be euphoric and may fall in love easily
and repeatedly.  You suffer from impulsiveness, poor judgment,
racing thoughts, sometimes explosive anger.  Milder degrees of
mania are often welcomed by you, family, and friends, who
admire your enormous energy and your many "irons in the fire."
Only when family and friends become aware of your poor
judgment in buying sprees, delusions of grandeur, or sexual
excesses do they try to encourage you to seek treatment, usually
against your own wishes:  Y (especially lithium therapy), E, P, T, W, X
</p>

<p>
Â§5.3. Manic depression: You are trapped on an emotional
roller coaster: at times you are depressed (see Â§5.1), and at
other times you experience the highs of mania (see Â§5.2):  Y
(especially lithium therapy), and therapies
listed under Â§5.1.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>6 Adjustment Problems</i>
</p>

<p>
Some critics of psychotherapy have argued that its main
purpose is to serve the interests and values of society: a person
is judged to be "abnormal" if he does not want, or refuses, for
example, to work from nine to five all but two weeks of the year;
if he does not accept the responsibilities society claims he
should respond to as an adult, a citizen, a husband, or a father.
These social demands&mdash;so critics of therapy have argued&mdash;have
been internalized by most therapists so that therapies often do
not really serve the individual's needs but rather the prevailing
belief-system of society.  Whatever validity the critics' argument
may have, it relates particularly to this area of emotional
suffering that falls under the heading of adjustment disorders.
</p>

<p>
Some adjustment disorders clearly lie outside the boundaries
of this criticism.  For example, a woman faces the loss of her
husband and resulting poverty.  She becomes anxious and depressed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
and these feelings do not go away with time.  Or, a man
agrees to a job transfer, wants to succeed at his new position, but
is overwhelmed by anxiety in his new environment.  His anxiety
doesn't go away.
</p>

<p>
Â§6.1.  In relation to a new environment or an already familiar
one; work inhibitions:  H, M, E, P, N
</p>

<p>
Â§6.2.  In persons with counterculture attitudes and
values:  H, D
</p>

<p>
Â§6.3.  Emotional difficulties arising from poverty and from the
deprivations suffered by minority groups:  C
</p>

<p>
Â§6.4.  Inability to accept realities that limit life: e.g., financial
limitations, restricted opportunities, aging and death (see Â§9
below), jobs with "no future," responsibilities that stand in the
way of personal development:  F, H
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>7 Marital Problems</i>
</p>

<p>
It may be worth mentioning that after a period of therapy some
problems turn out to be marital in nature even though both
husband and wife believed them to be an individual's emotional
problem&mdash;the man's problem, not the wife's, or vice-versa, and
certainly not a "marital problem."  Sometimes it is only after
many individual sessions of therapy that the marital basis of a
problem becomes clear.  When appropriate, the expressed
willingness of a spouse to become involved in his or her partner's
individual therapy can be a real help, providing emotional and
treatment support and also saving time when in fact the marital
relationship itself contributes to the individual's problems.
</p>

<p>
General marriage therapy: Primary:  R, D, E, H, I<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary:  P, N, I<br />
</p>

<p>
For communication problems:  R, D
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>8 Family Problems</i>
</p>

<p>
There is a growing realization among therapists that many
individual problems are produced by families torn by conflict.
Often, family therapy can provide more effective help to a
troubled individual than therapy that treats the individual alone.
This seems to be especially true in many cases of schizophrenia
(see Â§12 below) and in fears of withdrawal of affection and of
abandonment (see Â§3.4 above).

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>12 Psychoses</i>
</p>

<p>
If you have a psychosis, you behave in response to delusions or
hallucinations.  Your behavior is seen by others as strange and
inappropriate; you are inclined to withdraw from social groups.
You are severely impaired, out of touch with reality, often unable
to communicate, illogical, rambling, incoherent.  Your emotional
responses are greatly out of proportion, even inconsistent, with
external events.
</p>

<p>
There are numerous forms of psychosis, including types of
schizophrenia, manic and paranoid psychoses, hysterical psychoses,
and others.  Since self-diagnosis for these conditions is
neither appropriate nor likely to be accurate, no detailed
discussion of the distinct forms of psychosis will be given here.  Any
diagnosis of psychosis requires a careful evaluation by a psychiatrist,
clinical psychologist, or psychotherapist.

Â§<i>13 Organic Disorders</i>
</p>

<p>
Â§13.1.  Senescence, Alzheimer's disease: Senescence is associated
with aging.  Three-quarters of persons sixty-five years old
and older have a chronic, disabling condition such as emphysema,
heart disease, or hypertension.  Most elderly individuals are
able to cope with these disabilities for the rest of their lives.
Some, however, begin to have psychological problems associated
with senescence&mdash;e.g., confusion, depression, paranoia,
and sometimes delirious states:  supportive therapies: (e.g., B)
and sometimes Y
</p>

<p>
In Alzheimer's disease, which is a distinct disease and not
simply a sign of aging, you may have numerous physical
complaints that cannot be traced to a physical illness.  You may be
irritable, lack energy, be apprehensive, show increasing forgetfulness
and changes of personality.  Family members may complain that
you "are not yourself."  Presenile and senile dementia are two
forms of Alzheimer's disease; both are progressively degenerative:  Y,
care by family or by nursing home to provide supportive environment,
planning of daily activities, etc.

Â§13.2.  Parkinsonism/Huntington's chorea: Both are movement
disorders that can produce psychiatric problems, including
depression and schizophrenic disturbances.

TAKING YOUR PERSONALITY INTO ACCOUNT
</p>

<p class="quote2">
What is challenging for a therapist is discerning the form of
learning that each patient can best utilize and then working to
adopt techniques that are best suited for the patient....  An
important area of research is a way of detecting in a patient his
optimal modes of learning.  If we can pinpoint these, we can
then more precisely determine the best means of therapeutic
operation.[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>]

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Some people are more amenable to certain approaches to
therapy than others; for example, some people like and benefit
from group therapy, while others hate it.  Sometimes what a
person likes or would prefer needs to be overlooked in favor of
treatment that is believed to be effective.  But the vast majority of
people who enter therapy do this of their own volition.  If the
therapy they enter is unsatisfying or downright distasteful to
them, they will soon give it up.  We simply tend not to learn and
profit from experiences we dislike or that don't fit the kinds of
people we are.
</p>

<p>
For some time now therapists have recognized that a client's
personality often tends to incline him or her toward certain
approaches and away from others.  In the second step in identifying
a potentially promising approach to therapy, you are encouraged
to take traits of your own personality into consideration.  It
is not merely the goal or problem that suggests a particular
approach to therapy, but&mdash;what is often more important&mdash;the
nature of the person.  Too little attention is given to the
appropriateness of an individual for a given kind of therapy.

  MATCHING YOUR PERSONALITY WITH<br />
  THE MOST PROMISING THERAPIES<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>1 Self-Discipline</i>
</p>

<p>
Therapies rely on self-discipline in clients in several ways:
</p>

<p>
Are you able to <i>stick</i> to a prescribed routine and do practical
assignments on your own outside of therapy sessions to practice
attitudes, communication skills, or behaviors?
</p>

<p>
Will you take <i>personal responsibility</i> for coming to regular
appointments on time?
</p>

<p>
Can you <i>give up</i> any real payoffs of being emotionally troubled?
</p>

<p>
When <i>any</i> approach to therapy is successful, it is in large
measure because a client has strong personal motivation, a
strong will.  However, some approaches to therapy depend more
heavily than others on a client's strength of determination.
They include:  M, O, E, P, I, N, H, A, X, T
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§2 Commitment to the Process of Therapy
</p>

<p>
Do you believe you can commit yourself to therapy that spans
many months and sometimes several years?  If you hope to gain
long-lasting benefits from your experience in therapy, you will
need to commit yourself to certain practices and ways of
thinking <i>after</i> formal therapy has ended.  Do you feel that you
have this kind of <i>tenacity</i> and <i>ability to follow through</i>?
</p>

<p>
These are both qualities related to self-discipline, but they
have more to do with sustaining a process over a long period of
time: in a word, <i>commitment</i>.
</p>

<p>
Do you feel you can develop a strong sense of commitment to
long-term therapy?  A
</p>

<p>
To a long-range plan for life improvement?  H, M
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>3 Patience</i>
</p>

<p>
If you are suffering from incapacitating anxiety or depression,
being patient about the process of therapy can be very demanding.
Long-term therapies require more patience, endurance, and
tolerance than do short-term therapies.
</p>

<p>
Are you able to put your trust in a process where results are
noticed only very gradually?  (If not, you may feel that what is
most urgent now is to obtain prompt relief from symptoms&mdash;see
the "Summary of Main Approaches to Psychotherapy," at the end
of this chapter, to get some idea of the average durations of the
different therapies.)
</p>

<p>
Therapies especially requiring patience&mdash;with yourself, with
the challenge, or with the duration of therapy&mdash;include:  A, H, M, X
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§4 Initiative
</p>

<p>
Some approaches to therapy offer very little direction or
specific advice from the therapist.
</p>

<p>
Do you feel that you have the initiative to proceed without
explicit direction from the therapist?  If so, what you probably
need in a therapist is primarily the capacity to understand you
well, to accept you as a person, and to encourage you in a warm
and positive way to do what you think is best:  B
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>5 Tolerance to Frustration</i>
</p>

<p>
Do you have a fairly high threshold of frustration when your
beliefs and ideas are challenged?  When you do not immediately
get what you want, can you tolerate fairly well what may seem
like a long route to get where you want to go?  (Do you cope well
with the frustration of getting lost in your car, for example?)  Can
you tolerate, without serious irritation, anger, or hurt, being
pushed to confront some of the pretenses or distortions or
illusions you may have lived by?
</p>

<p>
Can you accept, with some calmness of mind, having someone
point out to you that you have not been as clear about things as
you thought, and that sometimes your attitudes are not consistent,
that you are, to some extent, confused?  A, C, E, P
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>6 Rigidity</i>
</p>

<p>
Do you often find yourself trying to be, or wishing you were
someone you're not?  C
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
</p>

<p>
Are you perfectionistic?  Upset when you make even fairly
minor mistakes?  Concerned that "things be in their proper
place"?  Are you frequently intense and uptight?   C, J
</p>

<p>
Are you "overcontrolling"&mdash;anxious when you do not feel you
have things clearly under control?
</p>

<p>
Are you depressed (see Â§5, Table 1) or phobic (see Â§4.2, Table 1)?
</p>

<p>
Do you suspect that other people think that you magnify evils,
blowing negative things out of proportion?  Are you inclined to
be moralistic, dogmatic, critical, or judgmental?
</p>

<p>
Are you an uncompromising person?
</p>

<p>
Do you feel, deep down, that perhaps your expectations and
demands (concerning others, yourself, and the world) may be
unrealistic?
</p>

<p>
Do you think you are often inclined to confuse what you
would like with what you need?  E, P, H
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>7 Inhibition</i>
</p>

<p>
Do you feel blocked, inhibited, or held in check by an overly
critical self?  B
</p>

<p>
Do you feel that you have pent-up feelings that are in need of
release?  Do you feel stultified or oppressed by your relationships
with your spouse, friends, or family?  Does your life lack
emotional intensity?  Do you obtain little joy or satisfaction from
living?  C, J
</p>

<p>
Do you feel that somehow there are blocks <i>in you</i> that are
standing in the way of your self-realization, of fulfilling your
potential?  H
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>8 Introversion or Extroversion</i>
</p>

<p>
Are you inner-directed?  Would you rather be alone or with one
or two friends than attend a party?  Are you impatient, or do you
even resent receiving unsolicited suggestions?   A, F
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, are you at ease with groups of people?  Is it
important to your self-image what other people think of you?
(Are you perhaps status-oriented?)  Do you often find
it useful or helpful to receive advice?   Q
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>9 Motivation and Capacity for Physical Exercise</i>
</p>

<p>
Are you free of physical handicaps?
</p>

<p>
Do you <i>like</i> to be physically active, to exercise?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
</p>

<p>
Do you begin to feel restless when a week or more goes by and
you have been sedentary?
</p>

<p>
If you are not physically fit now but are healthy, does it appeal
to you to work regularly and hard to become physically stronger
and to improve your endurance?   T, J, yoga (see U)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>10 Need for Acceptance, Human Warmth,<br />
and Gentle Encouragement</i>
</p>

<p>
Do you feel that perhaps no one has ever taken the time to
listen to you, to take a genuine interest in you and in your
problems as a person?
</p>

<p>
Do you feel, perhaps because of circumstances or problems
over which you've had no control, that you have received rather
little human warmth from others?
</p>

<p>
Would you prefer encouragement that is patient and warm
rather than a forceful push to change your life?  B
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>11 Articulateness and Analytical Attitude</i>
</p>

<p>
Can you talk openly and clearly about your feelings, about
what is troubling you?  Can you fairly readily describe examples
of situations that may bother you?
</p>

<p>
If you were asked to describe the <i>personality</i> (not his or her
physical features and behavior) of someone you talked with last
night for half an hour at a party, could you do this without a lot
of hesitation and brow-furrowing?
</p>

<p>
Do you <i>like</i> to talk about personal problem solving, about your
feelings, past events, and why you have come to feel as you do?
Do you feel a <i>need</i> to acquire an overall sense of understanding
of yourself, your family, and how they have influenced you?   A
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>12 Reflectiveness</i>
</p>

<p>
Do you often find yourself thinking about your feelings, about
the purpose of life, and about whether yours has a meaningful
direction?
</p>

<p>
Do you tend to come home from a visit with friends or family
and go over in your mind what went on and wonder why people
said and did certain things?
</p>

<p>
Do you have a mental habit of standing apart from what you're
doing and judging yourself and your work?
</p>

<p>
Do you spend much time just "thinking about things," even
dwelling on problems that concern you?  A, G
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>13 Imagination</i>
</p>

<p>
As a child, did you have an imaginary friend?
</p>

<p>
When you sit on a rock by a brook in the woods, do you
quickly begin to feel a special sense of relaxation?  Or, watching
the waves breaking on the beach, do you find yourself lulled into
a sense of absorption in nature?
</p>

<p>
Do you enjoy reading?  As you read a descriptive novel, do you
tend to "see" many of the places and people?  Do the events come
alive for you?  Do you find yourself thinking about the events in
the book as though they make up a real world of their
own?  W
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Â§<i>14 Sensitivity to Values</i>
</p>

<p>
Are personal values very important to you?  For example, do
you sometimes find yourself thinking that so much of television
programming is mediocre, trash, a waste of time?  Do you <i>feel</i>
that there are human values that are more important than how
much money you make, what model car you drive, and the
luxuriousness of your home?
</p>

<p>
Are you a religious or spiritual person, whether you attend
church or not?
</p>

<p>
Do you like art, music, or literature?
</p>

<p>
Do you feel, really feel, a sense of compassion or empathy for
people who face poverty and misfortune?  Do you sometimes feel
guilty because of your own situation, that there always seem to
be others who are worse off?
</p>

<p>
Have you ever faced the opportunity to take advantage of
someone or of a situation and simply decided not to (even
though you <i>knew</i> you could do this without risk) because you
simply wanted to feel honest or retain a sense of your own
integrity?
</p>

<p>
Are you in search of a richer meaning in life?  Do you wonder
whether what you are doing with your life is really right for
you?  G

Â§<i>15 Comfort in a Group Setting</i>

<p>
Do you feel comfortable and safe in groups?

<p>
Do you feel friendly when you pass a house where a party is
going on?

<p>

<p class="t3">
HOW TO USE THE INFORMATION YOU NOW HAVE
</p>

<p>
If you have followed the instructions for Steps 1, 2, and 3, you
should have identified a potentially promising therapy, or group
of therapies, in relation both to your goals or problems and to
your own estimation of certain important traits of your
personality or character.
</p>

<p>
The therapy or approaches to therapy you have identified now
need to be tested, first, in your imagination as you read the
chapters of this book, which will give you an idea of what each
major approach to therapy is like, and then, if you decide to
proceed, in reality, when you have located a suitable therapist
(see Chapter 17).
</p>

<p>
The need for this testing is a matter of simple realism: you now
have a sense of direction, or perhaps several alternative
directions, to consider.  The approach to self-diagnosis described in
this chapter is intended to be useful, but it is not infallible; much
depends on the accuracy of your problem diagnosis, the appropriateness
of the goals you have set, and your self-understanding.
Much also will depend on the therapist you locate and how well
you are able to work together.
</p>

<p>
The recommended therapies listed by letter codes for Steps 1
and 2 reflect evaluations from several sources: (1) Therapists
themselves claim that certain approaches favored by them have
been shown to be useful for treating certain problems, for
realizing certain goals, and for clients with certain personal
qualities.  (2) Various studies also have attempted to
demonstrate for what and sometimes for whom many of the major
therapies are most successful (see Chapter 20).  (3) Primarily in
the <i>ordering</i> of letter codes in connection with the specific
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
goals, problems, and personal qualities listed in Steps 1 and 2, I
have relied on my own experience and judgment. Letter codes <i>listed
first</i> designate therapies that, in
general, are commonly regarded by therapists and psychologists
as most useful.  At times, when general consensus appeared to be
lacking, I have used my own evaluation.
</p>

<p>
The intention in this chapter is to make explicit a simple and
reasonable process of choosing a therapy.  Many therapies are not
mentioned in connection with specific goals, problems, or
personality traits.  To be sure, some of the therapies that are not
mentioned <i>can</i> be useful to certain individuals who have a given
goal, problem, or trait.  But the objective of this book is to
improve the <i>general reliability</i> of a person's self-diagnosis and
self-understanding.  The book is a <i>guide</i>, not a bible.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
COMBINING APPROACHES
</p>

<p>
There is evidence that combining two therapies for certain
problems can frequently be more effective than using either in
isolation.  Treatment for individuals suffering from severe anxiety
or depression often will combine drug therapy, for example,
with one of the fourteen approaches to therapy described in
Chapters 9-12 and 14 (and listed below, under "A").  Or,
individuals who have problems due to excessive stress may, for
example, be advised to combine biofeedback, relaxation training,
hypnosis, meditation, or exercise therapy with a form of
psychotherapy.
</p>

<p>
Usually, when therapies are combined, one is a formal psychotherapy
and the other is an <i>adjunctive</i> therapy&mdash;that is, a therapy
that most often is not relied on exclusively.  Some adjunctive
therapies lend themselves very well to use by individuals on their
own.  Combined treatments tend, then, to employ one approach
taken from list A and one from list B:
</p>

  EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS<br />
  THAT MAY HAVE<br />
  PHYSICAL CAUSES<br />
</p>

<p>
This chapter has a single important purpose: to persuade you, if
you are in serious emotional distress, to have a comprehensive
physical examination <i>before</i> beginning psychotherapy.  Imagine
how disheartened and frustrated you might feel after a period of
unsuccessful therapy, only to find out afterward that your
problems could be traced to a physical cause.  It is essential that
you eliminate the possibility of a physical basis for your
problems before seeking therapy.  In fact, most therapists routinely
recommend that you have a complete physical before entering
therapy.
</p>

<p>
Rest assured that doing so will <i>not</i> be a waste of time.  Richard
Rada, Director of College Hospital in Cerritos, California,
estimates that between five and ten percent of clients with
depression, anxiety, or unusual thoughts and behavior may have
underlying physical conditions that are responsible, including gland
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
dysfunction, an epileptic abnormality, heart disease, cancer, and
so on.  The following facts, too, should convince you that having
a comprehensive physical is paramount:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* As many as one patient in every ten who suffer from
serious depression has a thyroid disorder.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* One person in every four who are diagnosed as having
psychiatric disorders and who are over sixty-five has an
underlying physical illness that is responsible.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* An equal number of individuals over sixty-five have
emotional problems that are made worse by underlying
physical disorders.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Three percent of people who regularly take prescription
medication develop mental symptoms.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dr. Leonard Small, a specialist in the field of neuropsychodiagnosis,
has found that the more severe emotional or mental
symptoms are, the more likely it is that therapists (and patients)
will overlook the possibility of underlying physical disorders.[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>]

<p>
It isn't necessary or possible to give a detailed or comprehensive
catalog of physical causes of emotional and mental disturbances
here, but it may be helpful to many people to see some of
the principal ways in which psychological symptoms can be
produced by physical problems.  Hopefully, these illustrations
will persuade you, if you are emotionally or mentally troubled, of
the wisdom of a thorough physical.  It is a small price to pay if
emotional symptoms can be traced to a physical cause.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that virtually any serious organic illness or
injury can produce emotional suffering, either in the form of
physical pain or in the form of anxiety and depression.  Chronic
pain is a chronic stress and can lead to the same emotional
problems as prolonged stress of any variety: anxiety or depression.
Similarly, prolonged severe anxiety or depression can cause
physical deterioration and make the body more susceptible to
disease.

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
</p>

<p>
There are, then, two "vicious circles," or feedback loops, that
can play a role in causing or aggravating emotional disturbance:

<br />
The two &quot;vicious circle&quot; or feedback loops that may <br />
exist between physical disorders and emotional disturbances
</p>

<p>
In the first loop, an underlying physical disorder, which may
be a disease or a physical injury, leads to emotional symptoms
(and very likely to physical symptoms as well, although these
may not be as pronounced).  However, the emotional reactions
that are produced can themselves make the physical disorder
worse, and certainly emotional disturbance makes living with
and treating the underlying physical disorder more difficult.
</p>

<p>
In the second loop, emotional disturbances cause certain
physical disorders: a peptic ulcer, heart palpitations, ulcerative
colitis, backache, hypertension, or high blood pressure, etc., and
may predispose certain individuals to arthritis, cancer, or
diseases of the immune system.  Once a psychosomatic link has been
established between a troubled mind and the body, and an
organic disorder has come about, the physical disorder, in turn,
can produce stronger or more exaggerated emotional reactions.
Anxiety or depression may increase because the person is now
both physically ill and emotionally troubled.
</p>

<p>
These two so-called positive feedback loops can obviously
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
lead to a runaway process that becomes worse and worse.
Psychosomatic medicine focuses on the second of these; our
focus here is on the first: physical origins of emotional
disturbance.
</p>

<p>
Underlying physical disorders of this kind include metabolic
diseases, disorders and diseases affecting the brain and nervous
system, head injuries, other physical disorders and conditions,
infectious diseases, reactions to medication, and drug addiction
and alcoholism.  Each is discussed in the remainder of this
chapter.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
METABOLIC DISEASES
</p>

<p>
Several well-known metabolic diseases can lead to emotional
disturbances:
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
HYPERTHYROIDISM
</p>

<p>
An overactive thyroid, known as <i>hyperthyroidism</i>, is usually
caused by the pituitary gland's overproduction of a hormone called
<i>TSH</i>, or <i>thyroid-stimulating hormone</i>.  This causes the thyroid, a
butterfly-shaped gland in the lower part of the neck, to produce
an excess of the thyroid hormone thyroxine.  Hyperthyroidism is
eight times more common in women than in men.
</p>

<p>
The emotional symptoms of hyperthyroidism include a more
intense and chronic nervousness than in hypothyroidism
(discussed below), overreactions to minor crises, moodiness,
frequent fear without knowing why, a sense of agitation, dread, and
occasionally trembling or shaking.  Some patients with serious
hyperthyroidism may have symptoms resembling those of
schizophrenia, in which there is little or no contact with reality.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms include rapid loss of weight, unusual
appetite, rapid pulse, diarrhea, and muscle weakness (especially
in the legs, as when climbing stairs).  The classical symptoms of
hyperthyroidism are staring eyes and enlargement of the neck,
but these need not be present.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that certain factors in upbringing and
personality seem to predispose people to hyperthyroidism (this
would mean that a feedback loop of the second type may
precipitate the disease in some people).  Individuals who later
develop hyperthyroidism often have these characteristics:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They were forced prematurely to become self-sufficient
and responsible.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They felt rejected by one or both parents and feared a loss
of emotional support.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Their early dependence needs (their needs for affection,
mothering, warmth, etc.) were frustrated, and this led to
feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem and to the belief
that the world is a threatening place.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They often had dominant, tight-lipped, overcontrolling
mothers.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
HYPOTHYROIDISM
</p>

<p>
An underactive thyroid, known as <i>hypothyroidism</i>, is caused
by an inadequate production of thyroid hormone.  It is most
common in middle-aged women.
</p>

<p>
The emotional symptoms of hypothyroidism include mental
sluggishness, nervousness, depression, irritability, impatience,
and frequently dislike of everyday activities.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms include a sense of heaviness and lethargy,
dry skin, sensitivity to cold, constipation, and thinning hair.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
HYPER- AND HYPOPARATHYROIDISM
</p>

<p>
The parathyroid glands, which are four bean-size glands
located on top of the thyroid gland, manufacture hormones that
regulate phosphorus and calcium levels in the body.  Excess
hormone raises the calcium level too high, and psychotic-like
behavior can result.  Too little hormone lowers the calcium level
to the point that a person may behave like an alcoholic.  These
conditions are comparatively rare.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
DIABETES
</p>

<p>
Diabetes, or hypoinsulism, which at the time of this writing
affects as many as 2.5 million
Americans, results from underproduction of insulin, which in
turn causes an excess of sugar in the blood and urine.  Diabetes
takes two forms: juvenile onset (or insulin-dependent) and adult
onset (or noninsulin-dependent) diabetes.  The first type starts
in childhood or young adulthood, and is caused by the body's
failure to produce enough insulin.  Juvenile onset diabetes is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
usually controlled by means of regular injections of insulin.
</p>

<p>
Adult onset diabetes is less serious than juvenile diabetes; it
occurs more often in the elderly and especially in people who
are overweight.  Diabetes can appear in a person after a traumatic
event: great stress, a physical accident, surgery, infection, or a
severe emotional disturbance.  It may also appear after a person
has gone through a long period of fatigue, depression, indecision,
or sense of hopelessness.  Those who become diabetic may
be individuals who felt strong resentment toward their parents
while growing up or who were "spoiled children."  Diabetic men
often were dominated by their mothers while being excessively
dependent on them.  Adult onset diabetes is usually controlled
without insulin injections, particularly during the early stages of
the disease.  Treatment in about one-third of noninsulin-dependent
diabetics is possible by diet alone; in others, it is necessary
to take oral hypoglycemic drugs that stimulate the release of
insulin.
</p>

<p>
The emotional symptoms of both forms of diabetes may
include apathy, depression, personality disorders, or even
psychosis as a result of undersecretion of insulin.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms include the need to urinate frequently, day
and night, unusual fatigue and weakness, tingling in hands and
feet, reduced resistance to infections (especially of the urinary
tract), blurred vision, impotence in men, and lack of menstrual
periods in women.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
HYPOGLYCEMIA
</p>

<p>
Hypoglycemia, or hyperinsulism, which affects perhaps as
many as five million Americans, is caused by overproduction of
insulin.  Excess insulin leads to low blood sugar (literally,
<i>hypoglycemia</i>).  Sometimes this overproduction of insulin is
caused by a tumor of the pancreas; the growth can often be
removed surgically to correct the condition.
</p>

<p>
The emotional symptoms of hypoglycemia include depression
and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms include fast pulse, palpitations, dizziness,
general weakness, faintness, stomach pain, blurred vision, and
sweating.  These symptoms often occur a few hours after eating
and disappear after eating again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
</p>

<p>
Hypoglycemia has become almost a fad disease among
"psychonutritionists."  The condition is believed by most physicians,
however, to be confined mainly to diabetics who have not kept
to a prescribed routine and have allowed their levels of insulin
to become too high.  Sometimes stomach surgery, liver disease,
pregnancy, and periods of high fever can cause attacks of
hypoglycemia.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  DISORDERS AND DISEASES AFFECTING<br />
  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
EPILEPSY
</p>

<p>
The second most common physical cause of emotionally
distressing symptoms, after the metabolic disorders we have just
discussed, is epilepsy.  Approximately 7 percent of mentally
disturbed patients have some form of epilepsy.
</p>

<p>
Epilepsy affects between 1 and 2 percent of the U.S. population.
Of people who have epilepsy, two-thirds appear to have no
structural abnormality of the brain; in the remaining third, the
disease can be traced to brain damage at birth, a severe head
injury, an infection that caused brain damage, or a brain tumor.
</p>

<p>
The emotional symptoms of epilepsy can involve either anxiety
or depression or both.  Once a person has had a convulsive
seizure, he or she may live in constant apprehension that another
seizure will occur.  There may be occasional, transient feelings of
unreality.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms include peculiar stomach sensations, distorted
vision, occasional bizarre behavior such as laughing for no
apparent reason or sudden and unprovoked anger, loss of
consciousness, and convulsions.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
PARKINSONISM
</p>

<p>
Parkinson's disease often causes anxiety or depression.  Physical
symptoms early in the course of the disease include slowing
of movement and inability to write one's name without the
handwriting becoming smaller and smaller.  Later symptoms
include tremors, muscle stiffness or rigidity, nervousness, and
tension.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
</p>

<p>
Multiple sclerosis usually begins in people between the ages of
twenty and forty, affecting slightly more women than men.
Symptoms may disappear after one or a number of attacks, or
they may get progressively worse and cause severe disability.
</p>

<p>
Emotional symptoms include anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms may involve a feeling of numbness or
tingling affecting one limb or one side of the body, temporary
blurring of vision, slurred speech, and difficulty or lack of
control in urinating.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BRAIN TUMORS
</p>

<p>
Brain tumors may cause severe headaches, blurred or double
vision, vomiting without the warning of nausea, general
weakness, and, in some cases, epileptic seizures.
</p>

<p>
Emotional symptoms may involve nervousness, irritability,
memory problems, and personality changes.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
HEAD INJURIES
</p>

<p>
Head injuries that damage the brain generally cause headaches
and dizziness.
</p>

<p>
Emotional symptoms usually involve nervousness and sometimes
confusion.  In more serious injuries, there may be loss of
memory, depression, and decreased alertness.  Severe damage to
the brain can cause unconsciousness that may persist for days or
weeks.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
OTHER PHYSICAL DISORDERS AND CONDITIONS
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
PANCREATIC CANCER
</p>

<p>
Cancer of the pancreas can cause severe depression and
insomnia.  These emotional symptoms can occur early in the
course of the disease.  This kind of cancer kills nine out of ten of
its victims within a year of being diagnosed.  One reason for this
tragedy is that pancreatic cancer frequently reaches an advanced
stage before the appearance of its physical symptoms: loss of
appetite and loss of weight, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
pain that may spread to the back.  It is believed that alert
psychiatrists can save many lives that otherwise would be lost as
a result of pancreatic cancer by detecting the disease in its early
stages.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
ANEMIA
</p>

<p>
Anemia is caused by an abnormal drop in either red blood
cells or hemoglobin (the main constituent of red blood cells).
Iron deficiency can cause anemia, as can vitamin B12 or folic acid
deficiency.  Inherited blood disorders such as sickle-cell anemia
can also lead to anemia.
</p>

<p>
The main emotional symptom of anemia is depression.
</p>

<p>
Physical symptoms include weakness, breathlessness, and
heart palpitations, which may occur as the heart attempts to
compensate for anemia by circulating blood faster than normal.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
HEART CONDITIONS
</p>

<p>
Mitral incompetence is a heart condition in which the flaps of
the mitral valve, separating the upper and lower chambers of the
heart, do not close properly.  The heart of a person with this
disorder must therefore work harder than normal.  Physical
symptoms may involve shortness of breath and fatigue.
</p>

<p>
Paroxysmal tachycardia is another heart condition, in which
the heartbeat suddenly speeds up to 160 beats per minute or
more.  An attack may last for from several minutes to several days.
Physical symptoms include breathlessness, fainting, chest pain,
and awareness of the rapid heartbeats.
</p>

<p>
The emotional symptoms of both mitral incompetence and
paroxysmal tachycardia may involve anxiety and panic attacks.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
MENOPAUSE
</p>

<p>
Menopause is not a disorder but a natural condition of aging
that involves changes in hormone levels in the body.  Menopause
in women can cause intermittent periods of strong anxiety,
chronic nervousness, depression, irritability, lack of confidence,
and headaches.  Physical symptoms include hot flashes, sweating,
and palpitations.  Male menopause is increasingly being recognized
by doctors; symptoms most frequently appear when a man
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
is in his fifties.  Emotional symptoms may involve anxiety and
depression; physical symptoms include hot flashes, sweating,
fatigue, and insomnia.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
INFECTIOUS DISEASES
</p>

<p>
Frequently, emotional symptoms are the first warnings of
infectious disease.  For example, fatigue and nervousness maybe
the only early complaints of patients who have hepatitis,
infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis, and many other diseases.
Anxiety and tiredness are symptoms that deserve careful
diagnostic judgment; they are not always innocuous.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
REACTIONS TO MEDICATION
</p>

<p>
Both over-the-counter and prescription medications can
sometimes produce emotional or mental side effects.  Too, as the
number of manufactured drugs increases, the potential for
interactions among different medications increases greatly.
Certain drug interactions produce symptoms of marked agitation,
restlessness, and anxiety.  Furthermore, patients who have
regularly taken a particular medication may sometimes find that it
begins to cause unexpected side effects.  "False senility" in
elderly patients, for example, is often induced by medication;
when the medication is stopped, the undesirable symptoms
disappear.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
DRUG ADDICTION AND ALCOHOLISM
</p>

<p>
Both are runaway habits that can cause nervousness and
overreactions to small crises.  Ironically, individuals are usually
first attracted to narcotics or alcohol in order to obtain <i>relief</i>
from anxiety.  But once the addictions have become firmly
established, emotional symptoms of depression, irritability,
sudden changes of mood, nervousness, and paranoia are common, as
are memory loss and difficulty in concentrating.
</p>

<p>
Caffeine is an emotionally habit-forming drug.  Real
addiction&mdash;i.e., physical dependence with withdrawal symptoms&mdash;appears
to be rare.  Nevertheless, coffee, tea, and cola drinkers
can become emotionally dependent on caffeine.  The drug is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
frequent cause of chronic nervousness in habitual caffeine users.
Smoking is a habit that causes a person to lose approximately
5Â½ minutes of life expectancy for each cigarette smoked.
Beyond this, smoking is also a common but unrecognized cause
of chronic nervousness, in spite of the fact that many smokers
believe smoking will help steady their nerves.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By now it should be evident that the two main signs of
emotional distress&mdash;anxiety and depression&mdash;can sometimes be
the symptoms of undetected physical disorders.  Especially in
cases of severe anxiety or depression <i>without</i> physical
complaints, both therapists and clients tend to overlook the
possibility of physical illness.
</p>

<p>
It is true that, at present, the majority of such cases cannot be
traced to underlying physical causes; they are therefore treated
by means of psychotherapy or psychiatric drug therapy.  As
medicine and biochemistry develop, however, mental and
emotional complaints are increasingly being understood in more
physical terms.
</p>

<p>
Emotional distress clearly does sometimes mask or camouflage
the presence of physical disorders.  If you are suffering from
serious anxiety or depression, it is important to have a
comprehensive physical before <i>beginning</i> psychiatric treatment.  This is
true especially when the onset of emotional symptoms was
sudden&mdash;within a period of days or one to two weeks.  It may be
most useful to see a diagnostic specialist&mdash;for example, a doctor
of internal medicine.  But bear in mind that physicians, even
those who are familiar with psychiatric problems, vary considerably
in their diagnostic skills, and sometimes a second opinion
can be worthwhile before you decide that the most appropriate
treatment is psychotherapy.

<p class="t2b">
PART II
<br />
EXPERIENCING THERAPY
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In Part II you will be able to develop an overall understanding of
the main approaches to therapy available today.  We will look at
psychoanalysis, the first of the psychotherapies, developed by
Freud at the beginning of the twentieth century; and then, in the next two
chapters, discuss ten major psychotherapies.  Because of their
widespread use and value, individual chapters will then focus on
approaches to behavioral psychotherapy, group therapy, and
marriage and family counseling.  The two final chapters in this
section deal with the therapeutic value of exercise, biofeedback,
relaxation methods, hypnosis, meditation, psychopharmacology
or the use of drugs in therapy, and dietary approaches.
</p>

<p>
In the discussion of each approach to therapy you will find:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* <i>a concise description</i> of its special perspective
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* information on <i>the kinds of problems</i> it is thought to be
most useful in treating&mdash;and closely connected with this,
but seldom taken into account&mdash;
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* a description of <i>the kinds of individuals</i> who tend to
profit most from that approach; and
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* an account of <i>a successful experience in therapy</i>,
reconstructed from the reports of clients as they look back
on their treatment
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3b">
HOW TO USE PART II
</p>

<p>
There are two ways you may find it profitable to use this
section of the book.  Perhaps you may decide to combine both of
them.
</p>

<p>
First, you can use the "map" in Chapter 7 to define your goals
and to suggest specific approaches to therapy that, based on your
own self-diagnosis, you might find most beneficial.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, you may not feel that mapping out your
problem or goals in the way that Chapter 7 suggests is for you.
Perhaps you are simply curious about the field and would like to
learn more about it, or perhaps you are considering counseling
or psychotherapy as an opportunity for personal growth and do
not have particular difficulties or issues that you want to focus
on.  For you, it may be more relevant to read about a wide range
of approaches and by so doing gain a clearer understanding of
what the alternatives are, how they work, and what they may
offer you.  This "window-shopping" can then form the basis for a
more informed decision later on if you want to enter counseling
or psychotherapy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE EXPERIENCES OF CLIENTS IN THERAPY
</p>

<p>
The reports in this book that describe the personal lives and
experience of real individuals in therapy have all been deliberately
recast to mask all traces of their identities.  Their names, life
situations, ages, and other characteristics have been changed.
</p>

<p>
Descriptions of the experiences of clients in therapy have
been greatly abbreviated and sometimes simplified.  As we have
already seen, counseling and psychotherapy last varying lengths
of time.  Even a very short period of therapy, over a period of
weeks, will bring to light much more detail than it would be
useful for us to discuss here.  The personal lives of the real
persons that are portrayed here are immeasurably more complex
and multifaceted than short reports can bring out.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we will use a time-lapse strategy, describing the
evolution of a person's therapy over a period of many months by
skipping over weeks at a time.  Always the intent will be to try to
convey to you how real people with real problems have come to
deal with their difficulties more effectively and often, in the
process, have been able to reach a richer understanding of
themselves and of others.

PSYCHOANALYSIS
</p>

<p class="t3b">
  <i>For wide-range improvements in individuals<br />

<p class="quote2">
The past hides but is present....
<br /><br />
Bernard Malamud, <i>A New Life</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis is the root from which the large family of
different theories of psychotherapy and counseling has grown.
Sigmund Freud's first efforts to develop psychoanalysis began in the
1880s.  He lived a long life and was active into his eighties; he
died in 1939.  Freud left behind one of the most important
contributions to the field of mental and emotional health.  It
formed the historical basis for the diversity of approaches that
would follow.  Even when later thinkers took issue with Freud,
their work in different ways relied on the foundation of his
pioneering work.
</p>

<p>
Many of Freud's ideas have worked their way into our everyday
vocabulary: the unconscious, the ego, repression, the Oedipus
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
complex, and so forth.  His work has influenced the study of
anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy, and literature.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
FREUD'S THEORY
</p>

<p>
During Freud's early medical training, he went to Paris to
study with a well-known neurologist, J. M. Charcot.  Charcot had
begun to use hypnosis to treat patients with certain physical
disorders&mdash;paralysis, for example&mdash;for which there was no
apparent physical cause (so-called hysterical symptoms).  Working
with Charcot, and later with a physician, Joseph Breuer, Freud
began to suspect that these symptoms were <i>motivated</i> by earlier
traumatic experiences that so distressed the patients that they
were forgotten (repressed).
</p>

<p>
Freud's theory of emotional and mental illness began then to
take shape around this central idea that neurotic behavior has a
<i>purpose</i>: there is an underlying <i>motive</i>, the motive itself is very
upsetting to the person, and so it is repressed from awareness.
But it continues to gnaw away below the level of conscious
awareness and eventually leads to the disturbance that brings the
patient to the point at which he or she is in need of professional
help.  Freud believed that recovery would occur if a patient could
be helped to gain insight into these painful events and feelings
that had been forgotten or suppressed.  In a moment, we will look at two real
examples.
</p>

<p>
Freud's theory has several dimensions.  First, his theory offers
an explanation of how the mind operates through its defense
mechanisms: as we have noted, excessively painful feelings and
memories are repressed.  Second, his theory tries to identify the
different psychologically critical stages children go through on
their way to adulthood: the oral, anal, and genital stages.  And
third, his theory seeks to distinguish the parts of the psyche,
which together underlie an individual's personality: the <i>ego</i> (the
rational portion of the mind that deals with reality), the <i>id</i>
(made up of basic instincts that press for gratification), and the
<i>superego</i> (formed from parental influences that have been
internalized).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
HOW PSYCHOANALYSIS IS DONE
</p>

<p>
Together, these three so-called dynamic, developmental, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
intrapsychic dimensions of Freud's theory make up the general
framework of psychoanalysis.  The central technique of psychoanalysis
is to help the patient become aware of motives that are
unconscious.  Psychoanalysis, or analysis for short, is basically an
attempt to extend self-control, bringing disturbing feelings and
behavior under a person's conscious management.
</p>

<p>
One of the principal techniques is free association.  The
patient is made to feel relaxed and comfortable&mdash;one reason a
couch is sometimes used.  He is encouraged to talk in an
uninhibited way about his concerns and feelings.  During this
process, the analyst usually remains detached and restrained so
as not to interfere with the patient's free expression.  From time
to time, the analyst shares with the patient certain of the
interpretations he has developed on the basis of the patient's
reports and behavior.  The analyst's objective is to help the
patient recover lost and painful memories that are responsible
for the conflicts, weaknesses, or inabilities that cause the patient
to suffer.
</p>

<p>
This process can be very hard on the patient: he or she must
revisit experiences that may be very painful.  Analysis requires
perseverance, endurance, and courage.  It is not, as we will see,
for everyone or every problem.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important developments in psychoanalysis
has to do with the increasing popularity of psychoanalytic
psychotherapy (also called <i>dynamic psychotherapy</i>), meaning
psychoanalysis that is extremely brief (12 to 20 sessions, for
example).  Considerably more patients are now treated with
psychoanalytic psychotherapy than with traditional, intensive
psychoanalysis.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
TWO EXAMPLES OF PSYCHOANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
Other than the length and intensity of treatment, the main
difference between Freudian psychoanalysis and brief analysis
has to do with the amount of emphasis that is placed on sexual
matters.  Freud believed that an infant's relationship to his
environment and parents is predominantly <i>sensual</i>: a baby seeks
oral gratification; his attention is absorbed by what he puts into
his mouth.  Later, attention is focused on excretory processes;
toilet-training requires the child to exercise self-regulation for
the first time.  Later, genital sexuality becomes the dominant
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
interest.  These sexual phases of development identify the
dominant areas of attention that influence the infant, the child, and
then the adult in their behavior toward others.
</p>

<p>
Brief psychoanalysis generally does not affirm Freud's sexually
based (libido) theory of motivation.  The second example that
follows illustrates this shift of emphasis.  The first example was
described by Freud himself[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>]; the second illustrates brief
psychoanalysis.

<p class="t3">
A CASE FROM FREUD
</p>

<p>
Freud describes the analysis of a girl who has repressed a
strong desire for sexual intercourse with her father and has, as a
result, developed a bizarre pattern of behavior.
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously, the dread of actually making love with him has
generalized to a dread of sexual activity of any kind.  Without any
conscious intent on her part, an association is formed between
sexual intercourse and breaking a vase.  She is not aware of the
unconscious symbolic connection she has established between
these acts.  Similarly, she begins to associate the bolster at the
head of her bed with her father and identifies her mother with
the headboard.
</p>

<p>
The pressure of this repressed material impels her to go
through an elaborate ritual each night before she can get to
sleep.  First she arranges the several vases in her room so that she
feels they are well protected against being broken (thereby
guarding against sexual intercourse).  Then she makes sure that
the bolster does not come into contact with the headboard (in
this way she gains the substitute satisfaction of keeping her
mother and father apart).
</p>

<p>
As her analysis proceeds, and the analyst is able&mdash;and here,
timing is important&mdash;to encourage her to become conscious of
her repressed feelings and generalized dread of sex, her need for
the nightly ritual is gradually eliminated.
</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to think of other problems, sometimes of a
handicapping kind, that, because of their obsessive or
compulsive nature, interfere with normal living.  Compulsive
handwashing is a classical example; compulsive overeating, bulimia,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
and its opposite, anorexia nervosa, as well as nymphomania, a
need for sexual promiscuity, are a few others.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
AN EXAMPLE OF BRIEF PSYCHOANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
Dr. Richard Chase is a psychiatrist who specializes in
emotional problems of children.  John and Rachel Edmonton have
come to see him about their twelve-year-old son, Bobby, their
only child.  John is an evangelical minister in his early forties who
travels a great deal, taking his family with him.
</p>

<p>
When Bobby was eight years old, he began to have strange and
violent nightmares.  He would go to sleep and then apparently
awaken about an hour later, asking for a drink of water or
expressing a need to go to the bathroom.  A few minutes later,
Bobby would seem to lose his balance and stumble over
furniture, sometimes running into walls, crying aloud that he was
"turning inside out" and was dying.  Often his parents would
have to restrain him to keep him from hurting himself.  After a
few minutes, the nightmare would end and Bobby would come
out of it, a terrified, confused little boy in tears.
</p>

<p>
So far, John and Rachel, with their frequent moves, had not
been able to get professional help that had made a difference.
Bobby had been examined by a neurologist, and an
electroencephalograph test was done to determine if some kind of
epileptic disorder might be involved.  The test was negative.
They had also taken Bobby to a child psychologist, who said that
Bobby was bright, sensitive, and precocious, that this kind of
nightmare was called a <i>night terror</i> (<i>pavor nocturnis</i>), and that
the problem would eventually subside.
</p>

<p>
Four years passed, and the night terrors did not.  The family of
three was becoming battle-scarred.  Bobby hated to go to bed at
night, fearing the inevitable.  His parents, sometimes patient,
sometimes not, used whatever ways they could, even a prescribed
sedative for Bobby, so he could relax and get to sleep, to
no avail.
</p>

<p>
Could Dr. Chase help?
</p>

<p>
Dr. Chase decided to meet with Bobby by himself.  He found
that Bobby was very willing to talk about his "bad
dreams."  Dr. Chase asked him to describe what happened each night.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Doctor," Bobby began, "it's really awful.  I know it's going
to happen, but I can't do anything to stop it.  I stay up as late as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
I can, and I will do anything not to go to sleep.  But when I do, I'll
<i>kind of</i> wake up a little later, and I'll see Mother and Dad looking
very worried.  At the same time, I'll see a box, with white walls,
glowing brightly, but not in the room where Mother and Dad are.
It's in some space, I guess it's in my mind, a black space, with that
white-colored cube just floating there.  And then it begins to turn
inside out.  My stomach feels like it's turning inside out, and it
hurts and scares me.  It feels awful.  I really think if the cube
turned all the way inside out, I'd die.  But it never does; I always
wake up first."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Chase began to meet with Bobby three times a week.  He
gradually gained his trust.  At a session during the third week of
treatment, he asked Bobby if he would play a word association
game with him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
  DR. CHASE: Tell me what you think of when I say, "dog."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOBBY: Cat.<br />
  DR. CHASE: Black.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOBBY: White.<br />
  DR. CHASE: Chair.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOBBY: Cushion.<br />
  DR. CHASE: Box.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOBBY: House.<br />
  DR. CHASE: Angry<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOBBY: Mad.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dr. Chase spent about fifteen minutes writing down some of
Bobby's associations.  Bobby gave back associations in the rapid-fire
way Dr. Chase asked, doing this almost automatically, leaving
no time to deliberate.  Gradually, Dr. Chase felt he saw a pattern
emerging, and he was able to confirm this from Bobby's
associations in later sessions.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of the sixth week, Dr. Chase sketched for
Bobby's parents the interpretation he had developed during
Bobby's short-term experience in psychoanalysis: "I believe
Bobby has unconsciously been trying to tell you something in a
highly symbolic form: often the mind expresses deep-seated
fears in the imagery of dreams.
</p>

<p>
"I've tested Bobby in a variety of ways.  Always, he appears to
associate the box in his dream with home or with a house.  I'm
fairly certain that 'being turned inside out' symbolizes for him
the process of moving out of all the houses you have moved away
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
from.  A house really is turned inside out when you move: all of its
contents are taken out, usually in boxes.
</p>

<p>
"I believe Bobby is hurting because of your frequent moves.  I
think if you will stay in one place, even though I realize that you,
John, would probably have to give up evangelical work, you will
gradually see a real improvement in Bobby."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Chase's advice was received with a good deal of disbelief
by John and Rachel, but they did, eventually, decide to try it.  John
became assistant minister at a local church.
</p>

<p>
Two years later, Dr. Chase received the following letter:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
Dear Dr. Chase:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Maybe you'll remember treating our son, Bobby, for what you
called his "recurrent night terrors."  My wife and I followed
your advice: We told him we had decided to stay in Atlanta, so
that he could go to the same high school for all four years.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In about two months, Bobby's night terrors were down to
about one a week.  After three months had passed, the suffering
our family has endured for more than five years came to an
end.  Bobby hasn't had another episode since then.  He's doing
well in school, has friends, and seems quite happy.  We all are.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It's sure a pleasure to be freed from the experience that
terrorized us all.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
Bless you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  John and Rachel Edmonton<br />
</p>

<p class="t3b">
AN ANALYST LOOKS BACK AT HIS OWN PSYCHOANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis is unique among approaches to counseling and
psychotherapy in that it requires analysts, as a part of their
training leading to certification, to undergo psychoanalysis
themselves.  Not only is this intended to be an educational
experience, but it is considered essential to their competence in
later professional practice: it is important that they be
completely aware of what are called <i>countertransference</i> feelings
toward patients.  Just as patients develop toward their therapists
feelings they had toward significant persons in the past&mdash;called
<i>transference</i>&mdash;the analysts, no less human, do the same.  Their
relationships with their patients can revive some of the analysts'
own conflicts.  They will be unable to understand the patient
clearly, free from distortions created by their own
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
countertransference tendencies, unless they have come to understand
themselves as thoroughly as it is possible to do so by means of their
own psychoanalysis.
</p>

<p>
After undergoing a long and intensive period of personal
analysis while in psychoanalytic training, Dr. Tilmann Moser
referred to his analysis as "a successful life-saving operation for
my soul."  He sought relief from depression, caused, he now
believes, by a troubled relationship with his parents.  He
describes his experience in these terms:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Psychoanalysis is a piece of the work of conciliation with one's
own origins.  The important ability to be implacable, attached
to the wrong place in the neurotic unforgivingness toward ... [my]
parents, has been freed for aspects of life where it can be
used for efforts directed toward social change, the changing of
conditions that cause avoidable suffering to countless human
beings.  The longtime impassable road of affection toward my
parents, based on humor, has been re-opened.[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>]

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
APPLICATIONS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
In general, psychoanalysis is successful in bringing about what
are called <i>broad-spectrum improvements</i>.  It is less intended for
abatement of specific symptoms.  In other words, those with
highly <i>specific</i> goals they wish to achieve through therapy tend
not to be good candidates for analysis.  For example, a person
seeking specific and prompt relief from depression, public-speaking
anxiety, or shyness may not be appropriate for psychoanalysis.
Long-term, intensive psychoanalysis, because it is long-lasting
and very detailed, can lead to very broad improvements:
a sense of increased satisfaction in daily living; a stronger, more
positive sense of self-esteem; a greater capacity to enjoy and be
at ease with others.  In the process, specific symptoms often do
subside or disappear, but the focus is general, and the patient
must be willing to embrace a commitment to general improvement.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, <i>brief</i> psychoanalysis may begin by focusing
on specific problems experienced by a patient, but treatment
quickly widens in scope to touch on matters that affect the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
patient's life in a general way.  We saw this in Bobby's case, where
recurrent night terrors revealed his general need for the greater
emotional stability that comes from feeling settled, having
friends, etc.
</p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis is best suited to problems that fall into two
categories:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Problems that are clearly "neurotic" in nature: they
interfere with living to some degree but do not totally
impair you so that your life is clearly out of control, as in
cases involving psychoses (where you are no longer able to
distinguish reality from fantasies and hallucinations),
alcoholism, or drug addiction
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Problems that involve sexual difficulties, mood
disturbances, and impairment of personal relations,
assuming that you are willing to work on these problems
within the wider focus that analysis usually requires
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis is <i>not</i> generally considered to be the treatment
of choice for severe impairments, such as alcoholism, drug
abuse, and psychotic disturbances, when your life is clearly out
of control.  Analysis is also <i>not</i> generally an appropriate form of
treatment for immediate problems arising from sudden environmental
changes, such as the loss of a job, or loneliness after a
transfer to a new job location, or after a divorce or separation.  In
some instances, if problems of this kind are not resolved after a
reasonable adjustment period, analysis might then be considered.
Other approaches to therapy lend themselves better to
specific and immediate adjustment problems, as we will see.
</p>

<p>
We have been describing the appropriateness of psychoanalysis
for the treatment of certain kinds of problems, but there is an
equally important, and frequently overlooked, question: whether
psychoanalysis is appropriate <i>for the kind of person you are</i>.
Psychoanalysis is best suited to individuals with these
characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are verbally articulate.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have a sense of curiosity about themselves.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have a good reflective capacity and an interest in
achieving insight through a careful analysis of their
thoughts, feelings, behavior, and past history.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are comparatively unimpaired in their abilities to
form relationships.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are able to tolerate the frustration, and endure the
pain, of re-experiencing disturbing feelings and memories.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are willing to be patient through a potentially long
period in treatment and can sustain a commitment to that
process.

PSYCHOTHERAPY, PART I
<br /><br />
  Client-Centered Therapy, Gestalt<br />
  Therapy, Transactional Analysis,<br />
  Rational-Emotive Therapy, and<br />
  Existential-Humanistic Therapy<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The approaches to therapy we will look at in this chapter are
called <i>humanistic therapies</i>.  They include client-centered
therapy, Gestalt therapy, transactional analysis (or TA), cognitive
therapy, and existential (or existential-humanistic) psychotherapy.
These approaches share the view that an effective therapist
must be able to become conscious of the world as it is for the
client.  Doing this requires the therapist to have a heightened
sensitivity to others, feel a fundamental measure of respect for
them, and ideally be able to adjust to their very individual needs
and concerns.  All of the therapies we will examine in this
chapter place priority on the client's subjective feelings and
experiences.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3b">
CLIENT-CENTERED THERAPY
<br />
  <i>For people who have not developed a sense of<br />
  personal worth; who are in need of<br />
  acceptance, human warmth, and gentle<br />
  encouragement; and who have the<br />
  initiative to proceed both in therapy<br />
  and outside of therapy without<br />
  explicit direction from the therapist.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The development of client-centered, or nondirective, therapy
has largely been the work of Carl Rogers (1902-1987).  His
clinical experience as a child psychologist and his later work in
training students in therapy led him to believe that people
frequently come to have personal problems as a result of the
<i>conditional</i> love of their parents.  To receive love and approval
from their parents, children must satisfy certain <i>conditions of
worth</i> the parents lay down.  If the children do not live up to the
parents' demands, they are punished by the withdrawal of the
parents' affection&mdash;a far more serious and emotionally scarring
punishment than a physical spanking.  Raised in this way, people
later in life will tend to link their self-worth to internalized
parental standards.  Rogers observed that the more the love
expressed by parents is conditional in this sense, the more it is
likely that a person will experience emotional difficulties later
on.
</p>

<p>
As a result, Rogers gradually developed an approach to therapy
that emphasizes "unconditional positive regard."  Ideally, a
client-centered therapist is able to express a sense of complete
acceptance and respect toward the client.  The therapist does not
associate positive regard with implicit conditions of worth that
the client must satisfy.  In other words, client-centered therapy
attempts gradually to reverse a habit that has come to undermine
the client's sense of self-worth.  It is a habit that we all, to
differing degrees, develop as parents and society teach us to
relinquish self-acceptance in favor of the conditional love or
appreciation of others.  Eventually, the habit becomes so
ingrained that it can jeopardize our own feelings of self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
Client-centered therapy encourages a client to grow in several
ways:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
</p>

<p class="point">
1. by feeling comfortable enough in the company of the
therapist to express feelings freely and openly
</p>

<p class="point">
2. by coming to recognize his own feelings of incongruence,
of being divided against himself, often due to experiences
that have encouraged a negative or insecure sense of
self-worth
</p>

<p class="point">
3. by perceiving that the therapist is an integrated, accepting
person, able to convey acceptance and warmth toward the
client
</p>

<p class="point">
4. by reintegrating a sense of self, freeing himself from the
distortions of self-worth brought about by love that has
strings attached
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
AN EXAMPLE
</p>

<p>
Melissa Adams is twenty-eight years old, the district manager
of a large pharmaceuticals marketing division in the Midwest.
She is slender, immaculately dressed, and&mdash;as Dr. Feldman could
see immediately&mdash;rigid and very uptight about herself.
</p>

<p>
Melissa came to see Dr. Feldman, a clinical psychologist,
because of a growing sense of estrangement toward her husband
and tension and anxiety at work.  She described her upbringing in
an extremely rigid, judgmental atmosphere in which her self-worth
was implicitly tied to her parents' conditions of achievement.
She was apparently encouraged by her parents, who
realized Melissa was a bright child, to skip a grade and then to
complete her undergraduate work in three years by attending
summer school each summer.  Her parents were very proud of her.
</p>

<p>
She admitted to having had little fun and would turn a vacation
into an opportunity for achievement.  She frequently could not
enjoy television or the movies "because it felt frivolous."  She was
free from self-doubts only when hard at work, so she worked
virtually all the time.  Her husband wanted a family, but Melissa
believed that children would be an undesirable interruption and
distraction.
</p>

<p>
Melissa quickly lost her fear of the weekly meetings with
Dr. Feldman.  She was able to relax in his company.  She felt that he
cared about her as a person, whether she achieved or did not.  He
would not make active, directive suggestions, but rather listened
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
to her in a genuine, positive way.  During one session, Melissa
asked him if he would give her some "straight advice" about her
relationship with her husband.  Dr. Feldman declined.  He felt that
telling another person what to do did not show respect for that
person's individuality.  He could see that Melissa was intelligent.
He believed that she could trust her own decision-making
abilities, and he would encourage her to believe in herself.
</p>

<p>
Over a period of a little more than a year, with weekly visits,
Melissa's personality began to soften.  She dressed more casually.
She was more relaxed.  She was beginning to enjoy herself more,
although occasionally the old self-doubts would come back to
assail her.  But she usually was able to fend them off.  Her marriage
was improving, she looked forward to "a real vacation" in the
near future, and she was not closed to discussing the possibility
of children with her husband, although they had not yet made a
decision on that issue.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF CLIENT-CENTERED THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Client-centered therapy focuses especially on difficulties that
stem from a client's negative feelings of self-worth.
Client-centered therapy may be the therapy of choice especially for
individuals who feel anxiety, uncertainty, and pain because of a
low sense of self-esteem.  A client-centered therapist can be
expected to value personal genuineness, integrity, and honesty.
The approach can be helpful to persons who suffer from
loneliness and isolation.
</p>

<p>
Client-centered therapy is most effective for individuals with
these characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are able to exercise initiative, both in expressing
their difficulties to the therapist and in attempting to make
desired changes.  Most client-centered therapists will
refrain from giving direction.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are interested primarily in personal growth rather
than the removal of specific symptoms.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are blocked, inhibited, or rigid because they are too
self-critical.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are not severely impaired in their abilities to relate
to others.

GESTALT THERAPY
<br />
  <i>For very rigid people who are always trying to<br />

  frustrating process of growth leading to<br />
  personal integration and genuineness.</i><br />

<p class="t3">
GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY
</p>

<p>
Gestalt therapy has its roots in Gestalt psychology, which was
established early in this century by the German psychologists
Wolfgang KÃ¶hler (1887-1967), Kurt Koffka (1886-1941), and
Max Wertheimer (1880-1943).  The main contribution of
Gestalt psychology consisted of studies of human perception.
Gestalt psychologists demonstrated that perception reveals the
existence of organized wholes that cannot be reduced to the
sum of their parts.  They called such an organized totality a
<i>Gestalt</i>.  (Outside of psychology, <i>Gestalt</i> in German means
"form.")
</p>

<p>
A famous example, shown below, demonstrates how an object
that you see can be closely linked to its background.  Here, the
figure and the ground can oscillate, depending on whether you
concentrate on the faces or the vase.  The figure depends on its
background for its identity, and vice versa.
</p>

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
GESTALT THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Frederick (Fritz) Perls (1893-1970) brought together certain
of the basic concepts of Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis,
and psychodrama, an approach to therapy developed by
J. L. Moreno (1889-1974) that emphasizes role-playing, acting out of
fantasies, and group interaction.
</p>

<p>
Perls transformed the Gestalt psychologists' central idea so it
would serve as a basis for his approach to psychotherapy.  Let's
look at an example.
</p>

<p>
A man has been stranded in the desert and has become
severely dehydrated.  He has wandered for several days in search
of water.  He stumbles along, nearly blinded by the sun, seeing
only vaguely defined shapes of rocks and cacti.  Suddenly, out of
this hazy world, something becomes clearly defined: he sees a
watering hole, surrounded by low bushes.  It is clearly etched in
his eyes, set against the indistinct background of the hot desert.
Once he has plunged his head into the water and quenched his
thirst, his Gestalt is <i>closed</i>: the need that caused him to struggle
for days has performed its purpose.
</p>

<p>
In this derivative sense, <i>Gestalt</i> means "a problem (figure)
that arises out of a situation (background) which motivates an
individual to action."  If his action is successful, his Gestalt is
closed: the problem is resolved, and the motivation is fulfilled.
Like the Gestalt of the psychologists, the closed Gestalt of
therapy signifies an organized whole.  In the example, the man
suffering from thirst in the desert has a Gestalt that impels him
to find water.  When he does, his thirst is satisfied, and the
Gestalt is resolved into a whole that no longer stands in need of
completion.
</p>

<p>
Perls saw life as a succession of unfinished situations,
incomplete Gestalts.  No sooner is one closed than another takes its
place.  To cope effectively with living, we must be able to deal
with life's problems and challenges, yet not all of us can.
</p>

<p>
Perls used the term <i>growth disorders</i> to refer to what other
therapists might call <i>personality disorders</i> or <i>neuroses</i>.  He
believed that emotional problems result from "getting stuck" in
the natural process of growth.  People get stuck in childish
patterns of dependency because of a variety of childhood
experiences.  For example, a mother and father may withdraw the
support of a stable environment, while a child relies on this for a
sense of security.  (The example of Bobby in the chapter on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
psychoanalysis may come to mind.)  Or, parents may force a child
to accept adult responsibilities prematurely.  It is as if a child
were asked to walk before his sense of balance and leg strength
had developed sufficiently.  The child will <i>learn</i> uncertainty; his
natural early fear of falling becomes pronounced and will leave a
mark that can stand in his way later.  Perls called such
experiences <i>impasses</i>, and they form <i>blocks</i> to a person's growth.
</p>

<p>
For Perls, human personality is like a multilayered onion: From
the most superficial, outside layer, moving inward, there is the
usually insincere <i>clichÃ©</i> layer ("How are you?," asked without
real interest), the <i>role-playing</i> layer (the habitual masks of
father, mother, businessperson, homemaker, therapist, client),
the <i>impasse</i> layer (the person stripped of clichÃ©s and masks,
often very frightening), the <i>implosive</i> layer (where emotions are
either vented or explode inward), and the innermost layer,
which makes up the <i>genuine</i> personality as it is, freed from
learned pretensions.  The goal of Gestalt therapy is to reach this
last layer.  In a word, Gestalt therapy seeks to encourage the
growth of <i>authenticity</i>&mdash;a combination of a balanced sense of
reality, of inner integration complemented by its outward
expression, personal integrity, and of independence from the need
for the approval of others.
</p>

<p>
In Gestalt therapy, self-change seems paradoxical.  As long as
inner conflicts continue, you try <i>not to be</i> the person you are;
you cannot be genuine and are divided against yourself.  Change,
the Gestalt therapist claims, is possible only when you give up, at
least for a time, trying not to be the person you are.  There must
be a firm place to stand from which to initiate change, and that
place can only be the person you are right now.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT GESTALT THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Gestalt therapy as it was developed by Perls is individual
therapy done in a group setting.  Gestalt therapists since Perls
most commonly continue to practice therapy this way: individual
members of a group are asked to volunteer to take the "hot
seat"; the volunteer then becomes the focus of attention.  This is
not group therapy where relationships among members of the
group are most important (see Chapter 13).  In Gestalt therapy,
emphasis is on the individual, who is pushed to drop his or her
masks and pretensions.  Other members of the group form an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
audience and try to learn by example until it is time to occupy
the hot seat themselves.
</p>

<p>
Perls would ask for someone in the group to sit in a chair,
facing him and the audience.  Then Perls would launch an attack
on the client's defenses.  At times, he could be almost merciless.
He did not believe in mothering clients; this served only to keep
their defenses intact.
</p>

<p>
Perls would notice nonverbal clues to the client's feelings.  If
the client was an inhibited woman, he would comment about her
thighs, which were pressed firmly together.  If the client was shy,
he would remark about how the client held one hand in the
other: Did he feel a need to have his hand held by Mother?
</p>

<p>
If the client burst into tears, Perls would make no attempt to
stop the tears with reassurance but would try to make the client
aware of his motivation in crying: Was it to elicit pity?  Were the
tears a way of hiding from self-responsibility?  Were the tears
another mask, standing in the way of self-acceptance,
authenticity, and growth?
</p>

<p>
The objective of Gestalt therapists is to tear away clients'
defensive masks and roles that usually keep them from real,
sometimes painful or frightening, feelings.  In this, the therapists'
main technique is to <i>frustrate</i> the clients' attempts to hide
behind their masks and roles and to <i>block</i> their attempts to
control their therapist.  Clients often do this by trying to make
the therapist feel sorry for them, give them parental warmth,
respond to their inadequacies, and so on.  Instead, Gestalt
therapy is comparatively <i>tough</i>.  Perls used these instructions in
beginning a workshop:

</p>

<p>
By refusing to give unnecessary emotional support even when
clients cry for it, Gestalt therapists convey through their
behavior that clients do have what it takes to stand on their own two
feet.  Ideally, Gestalt therapists are genuine, mature people; they
refrain from interfering in the lives of others and expect them to
be self-supporting.  They try to impress on their clients that they
do not exist to live up to the expectations of others, nor do
others exist to live up to theirs.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
APPLICATIONS OF GESTALT THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Gestalt therapy is most effective in treating persons with these
characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They tend to be very rigid&mdash;restrained, overcontrolled,
perfectionist&mdash;or depressed, or phobic.  That is, they have
certain well-defined fears; for example, fear of public
speaking, of insects, of sexual intercourse.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have become stultified in their relations with others
and have pent-up feelings in need of release.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They obtain little joy or satisfaction from living; their lives
lack emotional intensity.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are not excessively frightened by group activity.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Specific conditions Gestalt therapy often treats include these:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* psychosomatic disorders, such as stomach pain, colitis,
back and neck spasms, and migraines
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* behavior problems in children
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* difficulties in coping with persons in authority
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* shyness and passivity
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* emotional difficulties arising from poverty and from the
deprivations suffered by minority groups
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* rigid, conflict-torn family situations
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* crisis intervention: treating individuals in despair who
have lost the will to live or are suicidal
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
Gestalt therapy is <i>not</i> generally the treatment of choice for
people whose lives are out of control or who show signs of
psychosis.  Gestalt therapy relies on your capacity to make your
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
own practical life decisions, to tolerate the stress and frustration
of being in the hot seat, and to benefit from being challenged by
the therapist to confront your own pretenses, distortions, and
confusions.  People who have lost these capacities for the time
being due to problems such as alcoholism, drugs, and loss of
touch with reality tend not to benefit from Gestalt techniques.

<p class="t3b">
TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS
<br />
  <i>For less troubled people who want to improve<br />
  the effectiveness of their communication skills<br />
  and break free from frustrating, self-destructive<br />
  patterns.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Transactional analysis has perhaps done more than any of the
other main approaches to therapy to increase the sensitivity of
the public to the psychological dimensions of human relationships.
It has achieved widespread popularity in a short time
largely because of its simple, commonsense vocabulary that is
easy to apply to personal, family, and group situations.
</p>

<p>
Eric Berne (1910-1970) completed his medical training in
1935, then finished his psychiatric residency at Yale in 1941.  He
soon separated himself from psychoanalysis and began to formulate
his theory of transactional analysis (TA).
</p>

<p>
By the mid-sixties, TA was gaining in popularity: Berne wrote
his book, <i>Games People Play</i>, primarily for professionals, but it
became a best-seller filling a need for an easy-to-understand and
easy-to-apply approach to therapy.
</p>

<p>
TA is based on the premise that human personality has three
parts: Berne called them the <i>Parent</i>, <i>Adult</i>, and <i>Child</i>.  Although
similar in meaning to Freud's <i>superego</i>, <i>ego</i>, and <i>id</i>, Berne's
terms were intended to name dimensions of personality that
could be observed directly; his three "ego states" are not
theoretical constructs.
</p>

<p>
The Child ego state is the source of fun, humor, creativity,
wishful thinking, and irresponsibility.  It is impulsive and resists
control.
</p>

<p>
The Parent ego state is the repository of values, attitudes, and
expectations inherited from one's parents.  <i>Shoulds</i>, <i>oughts</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
hands-on-hips, and finger-wagging gestures are common
expressions of the Parent.
</p>

<p>
The Adult ego state is the source of reason, logic, and
unemotional evaluation.  It forms the basis for decision making
and predicting outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Only one ego state can be in control of our emotions or
behavior at a time.
</p>

<p>
Berne observed that many emotional difficulties in individual
clients result from problems involving their ego states.  Some
personality problems come about because a person cannot
separate his or her ego states and switches from one to another
erratically and uncontrollably.  For example, a young mother
begins&mdash;in a calm rational way&mdash;to describe the behavior of her
nine-year-old son.  She talks about his impertinent and
disrespectful behavior, and, as she does, she becomes enraged, her
face turns beet-red, and she yells at her therapist that someday
she is going to give her boy a beating he'll never forget!
Transactional analysis would try to show her that she tends to
slip from her reasonable Adult state to the state of an angry
Parent who demands complete respect and subservience.  Berne
called this structural problem of the personality <i>confusion</i>.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-133"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-133.jpg" alt="PERSONALITIES: Normal Personality, Confused, Excluded, Contaminated" />
<br />
PERSONALITIES: Normal Personality, Confused, Excluded, Contaminated
</p>

<p>
<i>Exclusion</i> is another structural problem.  An individual rigidly
adheres to one ego state, locking out the other two.  A Don Juan
gives free expression to his Child, while his Adult and Parent
states are suppressed.  A workaholic, on the other hand, permits
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
his Parent to block the expression of his Adult and Child ego
states.
</p>

<p>
<i>Contamination</i> is a third personality problem.  One ego state
subverts another.  A woman cannot commit herself fully to her
chosen profession because her Child has undermined her sense
of determination by persuading her that a wealthy knight in
white armor will soon appear to relieve her of the need to exert
herself.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Transactional analysis normally begins with "structural analysis"
in which clients are taught how to distinguish ego states that
may be confused, excluded, or contaminated.  This phase of
therapy is sometimes done on an individual basis and sometimes
in a group workshop or classroom environment.  Therapy then
proceeds to transactional analysis proper, in which frustrating
or painful forms of communication and unsatisfying life
directions are discussed.  Most commonly this is done in a group
setting, since a group encourages a variety of different styles of
communication.
</p>

<p>
TA teaches clients to determine which ego state is active at a
given moment&mdash;in themselves and in others with whom they are
trying to communicate.  <i>Transactions</i> or communication patterns
between people are the focus of TA.  Some typical transactions
are diagrammed on the facing page.
</p>

<p>
In (a) on the facing page, person 1 communicates in an Adult
mode and receives an Adult response from person 2: "Where are
you going?" "To the cleaner's."
</p>

<p>
In (b), a Parental boss receives a petulant response from the
Child ego state of an employee: "What took you so long?" "My
little boy is sick, and there's just too much work for one
secretary."
</p>

<p>
In (c), an Adult-to-Adult message receives a Child-to-Parent
reply; this is an example of <i>crossed transaction</i>.  It is one of the
most common sources of frustration and conflict in family and
professional life.  For example, a therapist says, "You seem to be
late for your appointment today."  (Adult-to-Adult, or A-A.)  The
client replies, "You're just like my father, always picking on me."
(C-P.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-135"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-135.jpg" alt="DIAGRAMS OF TYPICAL TRANSACTIONS" />
<br />
DIAGRAMS OF TYPICAL TRANSACTIONS
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
</p>

<p>
Diagram (d) illustrates communication that involves an ulterior
message.  For example, a psychologically clever salesman is
showing hair driers to a woman.  She tells him how much she is
prepared to spend and then asks, "How much is that one?"  The
salesman (arrow 1 in the diagram) replies: "You wouldn't be
able to afford that model."  His response is based on his customer's
stated budget limitations and appears to be Adult-to-Adult.
However, the hidden message (dotted arrow [1) is directed to
his customer's Child state, which, as he predicts, causes her to
reply rebelliously (arrow 2), "That's the one I want."
</p>

<p>
In (e), another example of this class of communications that
are not what they appear to be, there are two ulterior transactions.
A secretary returns a few minutes late from lunch.  Her
boss asks, apparently Adult-to-Adult (arrow 1), "What time is
it?"  They both know what the hidden message is.  The secretary
answers sharply (arrow 2): "It's 1:15."  The ulterior message
from the boss is "Are you late again?" (P-C: arrow [1].)  The
secretary's covert or hidden reply is "Get off my back: you're
always criticizing." (C-P: arrow [2].)
</p>

<p>
The central objective of TA, then, is to make clients aware of
these and other patterns or games that their habitual ways of
communicating reveal.  By doing this, clients find that communication
becomes less problematic and more effective as they learn
to control their responses.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
AN EXAMPLE
</p>

<p>
Joyce was forty-one when she decided to take her seventeen-year-old
only son, Joe, to see Dr. Goldstein, a transactional
analyst.  For about five years, ever since his father died, Joe and
his mother had quarreled a great deal.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Goldstein met with Joyce, then with her son, and then with
them both.  After he listened to their complaints about one
another, he agreed to try to help.
</p>

<p>
For six weeks, Joe and his mother met once a week with
Dr. Goldstein as "TA students."  They were to put family problems on
a back burner; their energy was devoted to learning to apply the
concepts of transactional analysis.  Dr. Goldstein had them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
analyze many examples of communication.
</p>

<p>
During a second six-week period, Joyce and her son were
coached to learn to talk to one another more effectively.  Here are
some samples of their automatic patterns of response <i>before</i> they
began to use TA:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: The soup's too salty.  (A-A or C-P)<br />
  MOTHER: I don't know why I work so hard!  All you do is<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complain!  I'm just not appreciated!  (C-P)<br />
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: Mom, here's the sports jacket I bought for graduation. (A-A)<br />
  MOTHER: You can't go in <i>that</i>!  We're taking that jacket back.  I<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't trust you to buy clothes for yourself.  Let's go! (P-C)<br />
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  MOTHER: We're going to dinner tonight at Esther and Gary's.  Get<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of those jeans; we have to leave in fifteen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes.  (P-C)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: But Mom, I told you last Wednesday that Fred and I are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going camping this weekend.  We're leaving in Fred's<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;car in just an hour.  (A-A or C-P)<br />
  MOTHER: I don't remember anything like that.  Esther and Gary<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are <i>expecting</i> us.  You're always wrecking our plans! (C-P)<br />
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  MOTHER: Mmm, isn't this the most delicious soufflÃ© you've ever<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tasted?  (C-P)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: That's it, compliment yourself!  (C-P)<br />
  MOTHER: Well, if I don't, no one else will!  You don't know how<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lucky you are, having a mother who really knows<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to cook.  (C-P)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: I sure hope I don't learn how to be modest from you! (C-P)<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The problems weren't hard for Dr. Goldstein to spot: Joyce
had low self-esteem, was easily hurt, and, when she was, put her
son down (the salty soup).  She wanted to be indispensable to
him and was unwilling to let him grow up (the sports jacket).
She had little respect for Joe's plans, especially if they interfered
with her desires (Joe's camping trip).  She felt unappreciated and
had grown to be resentful of her role as mother (the soufflÃ©).
</p>

<p>
Joe, on the other hand, was feeling the natural rebelliousness
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
of a seventeen-year-old.  He needed some free rein, even if he
made some mistakes.  His mother was always "getting in his hair"
or "getting under his skin."
</p>

<p>
The sample transactions above led each of them to anger and
hurt.  Seldom did Dr. Goldstein see Joe and his mother communicate
Adult-to-Adult.  Instead, their transactions crossed and
re-crossed, and resentments piled up.
</p>

<p>
Joyce saw Dr. Goldstein without Joe present for several weeks.
She learned from Dr. Goldstein that her expectations toward her
son were inappropriate; she needed to strengthen her sense of
self-worth outside of her family role.  She was excessively
dependent on her son for recognition and appreciation.  Especially
since her husband died, she was easily hurt when her desires for
appreciation were not satisfied by Joe, so she put him down.
What she needed to do was to strengthen her Adult and weaken
the domination of her self-pitying Child and overcritical Parent
ego states.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Goldstein then met with Joe for several sessions.  Joe began
to see his mother in a different light.  Dr. Goldstein made him
aware of his mother's sadness in being left alone and of her needs
to feel worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
During the joint sessions that followed, Dr. Goldstein typically
would ask them to recall recent conversations or exchanges that
had been unpleasant.  He would ask them to analyze these in TA
terms and then would push mother and son to imagine more
appropriate and less uptight ways of responding.
</p>

<p>
After several months of joint therapy, their former pattern of
transactions began to look very different:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: Mom, there's too much mustard on the ham.  (A-A or C-P)<br />
  MOTHER: Well, then it's OK with me if you want to scrape some<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off.  (A-A or P-C)<br />
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: How do you like my new tie?  (A-A)<br />
  MOTHER: I'd need a lot of courage to wear it myself, but I'm not<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you!  (A-A or C-C)<br />
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SON: Mom, your roast is delicious.  It's great to have a<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother who's a good cook!  (A-A)<br />
  MOTHER: Thanks, Joe.  I guess now I've learned that you really<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hate soufflÃ©!  (A-A)<br />
</p>

APPLICATIONS OF TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
TA has been used in individual and group therapy, in nonclinical
settings to help business executives improve communication
skills, and also in prisons.  It has been used to treat a wide
range of problems, including these:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* personality trait problems: e.g., shy, lonely, depressed,
overbearing, or hostile individuals
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* troubled relationships in couples and families
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* fears of withdrawal of affection and of abandonment
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* drug abuse
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* phobias
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* difficulties in relating to authority figures, such as a boss, a
teacher, a parent
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* adaptation problems in individuals with counterculture
attitudes and values
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Few controlled evaluative studies have been done to determine
how effective TA really is.  At this time, and in this author's
judgment, TA is most useful as an <i>educational therapy</i> to assist
less severely troubled individuals with communication problems
by helping them sharpen their perceptions of their own ego
states and the ego states of others.  TA is most effective for clients
who are able to exercise responsibility for themselves.  TA
appears to be especially useful in helping individuals who are
caught in frustrating relationships to break free from
self-destructive patterns or games.

<p>
By telling ourselves things like these, we create our own
unhappiness, frustration, and anger; that is the point of view of
cognitive therapy.  During the 1950s, Albert Ellis (1913-2007)
developed a theory of personality that claims that people are
largely responsible for their emotional reactions.  They tell
themselves that things <i>ought</i> to be different, that people <i>should</i>
do certain things, and that what they desire they <i>must</i> have.  Life,
for people whose thoughts are filled with <i>shoulds</i>, <i>oughts</i>, and
<i>musts</i>, is full of disappointment, annoyance, and hurt.
</p>

<p>
Ellis observed that, as time goes by, we tend to reinforce an
emotional pattern that amplifies our sensitivities more and
more.  The emotional reactions we create in ourselves become
more exaggerated, distorted, and self-destructive.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
</p>

<p>
But, like any habits, these mental (or cognitive) habits can be
broken.  Cognitive therapy attempts to do this.
</p>

<p>
Ellis called his own approach <i>rational-emotive therapy</i>.  By
this, he acknowledged that people have both rational and
emotional dimensions.  Their emotions and thoughts (cognitions)
are so thoroughly intertwined that they cannot be clearly
separated.  Yet mental evaluations and ideas are given so much power
that cognitive habits are responsible for emotional responses.  It
is thinking that makes it so.
</p>

<p>
Rational-emotive therapy is the most widespread approach to
cognitive therapy, so we will examine Ellis's approach in some
detail.
</p>

<p>
The main technique of rational-emotive therapy, and of cognitive
therapy in general, is to focus clients' attention on their
belief systems, their views about what "should" and "ought" to
be, their cognitive "filters" through which they interpret, in a
semiautomatic way, the world around them.  If the "activating
event" is a failure or a rejection, for example, a client's <i>rational</i>
belief system will lead to feelings of regret, sorrow, disappointment,
or annoyance; if an individual's beliefs are <i>irrational</i>, on
the other hand, he or she may instead feel depression, worthlessness,
futility, and severe anxiety.  For rational-emotive therapy,
emotional good health depends on the rationality of the way a
person receives and interprets events.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT RATIONAL-EMOTIVE THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Therapy usually begins with individual sessions.  Once clients
have learned how to identify mental habits that create disturbing
emotions, therapy is sometimes continued in groups, where new
attitudes and forms of behavior can be practiced in a kind of
microcosm of the larger world.  Rational-emotive therapy that is
done in a group context is not, however, "group therapy," since
the therapist's focus is on individual styles of thinking, not on
relationships among members of the group.
</p>

<p>
During therapy, clients are very quickly challenged to give
evidence for their irrational beliefs.  The rational-emotive
therapist will openly and ruthlessly oppose the foolish absolutes that
clients express and make it clear how they are upsetting
themselves emotionally by insisting on such nonsense.  It is not
considered essential that the therapist be a kind, warm,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
supportive person.  In fact, rational-emotive therapy encourages
therapists to show their impatience with irrational beliefs that cannot
be defended empirically or logically.  Once clients are shown
that many of their beliefs cause them misery and disappointment,
they are asked to <i>dispute</i>&mdash;silently, in their own minds&mdash;their
irrational beliefs whenever they find the old habits taking
over.  It takes time to extinguish old habits; it doesn't happen
overnight.  Clients need patience and tenacity to oppose their old
reflexes and replace them with rational, realistic beliefs.
</p>

<p>
An hour a week in rational-emotive therapy is really, then, like
a tutorial session with a teacher.  The client-students talk about
their feelings; the therapist criticizes underlying irrational
beliefs and makes it clear to the clients what a rational response
would be.  Then the clients are asked to practice applying
rational beliefs on their own, outside of therapy.  Gradually, a
more rational way of looking at things takes the place of the old
habits.
</p>

<p class="t3">
AN EXAMPLE
</p>

<p>
Joan Hendley is single, twenty-nine years old, and assistant
manager of a bank.  She has come to Dr. Kovac because of chronic
depression, a sense of low self-worth, and feelings of insecurity
and anxiety.  Lately, she has begun to drink heavily and regularly
feels the need to use sleeping tablets.
</p>

<p>
The following is a sample of their dialogue during their first
session of rational-emotive therapy:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  Well, what would you like to start on?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  It's hard to put it into words.  I guess it's that I've been
depressed a lot, about <i>everything</i>.  I feel like there's no
purpose to my life.  I don't know where to go or how
to decide.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  So, right now you don't know where you're headed.
What's so terrible about that?  It would be <i>nice</i> if you
knew, but you don't.  Is that <i>awful</i>?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  Yes, it is!  Everybody should have a purpose!
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  Why <i>should</i> they?  Most people go through life without
much of a sense of purpose.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  Well, that's what I believe in.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  Look, Joan, you appear to me to be an intelligent person.
You and I can agree that it would be more satisfying
for you to have a sense of direction, but you take this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
one more step, and it's a <i>very</i> big step!  You think it's
<i>terrible</i> that you don't feel there's a purpose to your
life right now.  You think you <i>should</i> have a purpose,
and I suspect you're punishing yourself because you
don't live up to that <i>should</i>.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  But most people believe in things like that.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  And a lot of them end up feeling miserable!  I know: I've
seen dozens of people sitting where you are, and their
thinking is chock-full of <i>oughts</i>, <i>shoulds</i>, and <i>musts</i>.
And that's what makes them feel upset.  They feel much
better when they can come to say to themselves, "It
would be nicer, or more pleasant, or better if things
were different."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  You mean, if I can get rid of <i>shoulds</i> and <i>musts</i> in my
<i>thinking</i>, I'd feel better?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  That's exactly what I'm saying.  If you were to follow
what I've told you, you'd seldom be upset again, and
probably never enough to get yourself really
depressed.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  Uh-huh.  I'm not sure I really see how that can be.  I feel
pretty stupid.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  So here you go again!  You think of yourself as a pretty
bright person, and so you say to yourself, "I ought to
be able to catch on to anything pretty fast."  And now
here you are, and you're not all that sure you've
followed everything already, and so you tell yourself,
"Oh my, I must be stupid."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  [Nods appreciatively, laughs.]
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  You don't <i>have</i> to upset yourself.  You can <i>choose</i> what
you tell yourself, and then you'll have control over
what you <i>feel</i>.
Tell me about your job.  You're in the role of a leader,
aren't you?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  Yes.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  But you don't think you're doing a great job?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  No, I don't.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  But <i>they</i> think you're doing OK, isn't that correct?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  Yes, but my job seems to be taking more and more out of
me.  [Begins to cry.]
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  Well, it seems like you're doing your job OK; it's just that
you, from <i>your</i> point of view, aren't perfect!  So
<i>therefore</i> it's all just empty pretense: you're just faking
it!  But, if you'll give up your nutty perfectionism, you'd
be in the clear, because you're obviously satisfying
people at work; you're satisfying <i>their</i> expectations.
But since you feel bad about yourself, you say to
yourself, "Well, they just haven't found me out!  When
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
they do, I'm in for it."  And so you live in a state of
fear.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  That's it.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  It's all because of your unreasonable <i>expectations</i>.  Can
you see that?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
JOAN:  [At least temporarily convinced.]  Yes, I think I can!
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. K.:  This is what I'd like to work on with you.  It's going to
take some self-discipline on your part, but together we
can help you get rid of some mental habits that bring
you unhappiness.  They don't serve a useful purpose,
and they drag you down.
Why don't you tell me more specifically what upsets
you at work?

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF RATIONAL-EMOTIVE THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Although rational-emotive therapy has been used to treat
many different kinds of problems, Ellis admits that his approach
is most effective for the treatment of clients with a single major
symptom or clients who are only moderately disturbed.  In
addition, Ellis does advocate rational-emotive therapy for
individuals whose patterns of irrational thought are severe, but for
such individuals&mdash;when they can be helped&mdash;therapy is a
long-term process.
</p>

<p>
From evaluative studies completed so far, it appears that
rational-emotive therapy is especially effective in reducing
anxieties resulting from such things as public speaking, relating to
others on an individual basis, and facing old age.  Other specific
applications of rational-emotive therapy include these:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems of maladjustment, where you have increasing
difficulty coping with either an already familiar
environment or a situation new to you
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* marital problems and sexual difficulties
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* psychosomatic problems
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* anxiety
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* depression
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems of criminals and delinquents
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Individuals who are most effectively treated with forms of
cognitive therapy tend to have one or more of these personal
characteristics:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They tend to think in very rigid ways.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are inclined to think in all-black, or all-white terms.
They are absolutists who think in terms of <i>what is right</i>
and <i>what is wrong</i>.  Life, for them, is an uncompromising
affair.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are often perfectionists about themselves, so they
tend to have unrealistic expectations of others as well.
They are idealistic.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Their behavior is frequently uptight, intense, judgmental,
and intolerant <i>or</i> shy, self-effacing, and inclined to
self-condemnation.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They tend to think that if there is one bad apple, the
whole bushel must be rotten.  They tend to magnify and
exaggerate evils.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They confuse what they would like to have with what they
believe they absolutely <i>need</i>.  They are demanding and
exacting.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
EXISTENTIAL-HUMANISTIC PSYCHOTHERAPY
<br />
  <i>For individuals who suffer from feelings of<br />
  acute loneliness and emptiness, who have lost<br />
  faith in themselves or others, and who tend to<br />
  be analytical and introverted.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There is no single, well-defined theory accepted by most
existential therapists.  Instead, existential psychotherapy is a
point of view, a general philosophy that attempts to describe
what it means to be human and to live meaningfully in the world.
</p>

<p>
There is, nevertheless, a consensus among existential therapists
concerning the objectives of the approach.  Existential
therapy seeks to help clients achieve these goals:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to accept and make constructive use of their own personal
<i>freedom</i>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to become <i>authentic</i> individuals, shedding the conventions
and conformities that obscure the real persons they are
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to establish human relationships based on <i>honesty</i> and
<i>personal integrity</i>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to be <i>fully present</i> in the immediacy of the moment
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to learn to <i>accept</i> the natural limits of life
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Existential therapy cannot be described in terms of a group of
techniques commonly used by therapists.  In fact, existential
therapists are inclined to resist the formulation and application
of specific techniques of therapy, believing that psychotherapy is
essentially a human endeavor and that the drive to formulate
techniques is basically a dehumanizing, objectifying interest.
</p>

<p>
To understand existential therapy, then, we ought not to
expect to encounter a set of specific techniques.  What really
characterizes existential therapy are its self-consciously
endorsed attitudes about life.  They include these realizations:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Anxiety frequently motivates individuals to change their
lives.  Anxiety often is present to tell you that you need to
change; it is not necessarily a bad feeling from which no
good will come.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Eventually each of us will die, and clutching life anxiously
will stand in the way of finding real meaning in living.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Past events need not control what you feel and do now;
you are free to change old, unsatisfying patterns.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Guilt is often a sign that you have missed opportunities for
personal growth: you have not been true to yourself and
have "sinned against yourself" in some important way.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* If you are to become a mature and genuine person, you
must discard the <i>lies</i> you have cultivated.  Among these is
living the lie of trying <i>not to be</i> the person you really are;
another is the lie of trying to be a person you are <i>not</i>, and
there are many others.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* To be content within the limitations of life, it is vital that
you have a sense of your own value.  You become
inauthentic if you base your sense of self-esteem on what
others think of you.
</p>

<p>>br /></p>

<p>
It is obvious that <i>individual responsibility</i> is central to
existential therapy.  You are responsible for the person you choose to
become.  You may choose to be genuine, or you may choose to lie
to yourself and others.  It is when you abdicate responsibility for
becoming authentic that you will often come to feel anxiety and
a sense of guilt.  Anxiety and guilt are often present, in other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
words, when there is a fundamental lack of congruence, of being
whole, of being in accord with yourself.
</p>

<p>
The main contributors to existential psychotherapy have been
the Swiss analysts Ludwig Binswanger (1881-1966) and Medard
Boss (1903-1990), along with Rollo May (1909-1994), who
was the founder of existential psychotherapy in America.  Today,
existential psychotherapy is practiced under a variety of names:
<i>humanistic psychology</i>, <i>experiential psychotherapy</i>, and also in
the context of the related approaches, logotherapy and reality
therapy (see Chapter 11).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT EXISTENTIAL THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Existential psychotherapy is usually individual therapy, with
sessions commonly scheduled a few times a week, as in psychoanalysis.
Existential therapy often shows its psychoanalytic origins:
as in analysis, existential psychotherapy focuses largely on
anxiety and the suppressed issues that anxiety veils.  Existential
therapists will push clients to confront anxiety directly; they will
try to understand the clients' anxiety in relation to the lies that
clients tell themselves in order to protect themselves from more
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
As we have already seen, existential therapists very commonly
regard anxiety and depression as <i>promising</i> symptoms because
they can shake clients out of unfulfilling patterns of living.
Anxiety and depression, instead of being viewed as undesirable
symptoms to be eliminated, can motivate people to change and
grow.  Consequently, existential therapists tend to disapprove of
the use of drugs in therapy.  If clients take pills to reduce anxiety,
for example, they will reduce the awareness of motivating pain
that, if faced squarely, may bring about a more meaningful,
satisfying life.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of the way an existential therapist forces a
client to face issues head-on.  What the therapist is thinking is in
brackets.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
CLIENT: I don't know why I stay with my job.  It just makes me
depressed.  All I do is tell you the same things over
and over.  I'm not getting anywhere.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
THERAPIST: [She is complaining because I'm not curing her.  She
has to do this herself.]  To be frank, I'm impatient,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
too.  We talk, but you're not able to act.  [She has to
see that I can't take responsibility for her
procrastinating].
</p>

<p class="quote2">
CLIENT: What do you think I ought to do?  I can't keep living
like this.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
THERAPIST: [I can't make her decisions for her.]  I can't tell you
which way to go.  I do know that you've been
avoiding a decision.  I believe you're going to take
charge of your life but, until then, we may both
feel impatient....
<br />
What <i>do</i> you want to do?  [She has to be pushed to
make up her mind.  She's ready now to decide but
is understandably scared.]
</p>

<p class="quote2">
CLIENT: I want to stop worrying, stop feeling so anxious and
upset.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
THERAPIST: [She'd like me to mother her.]  Look, Diane, you've
been coming to see me for three months now.  You
know what I think about feeling upset: if you're
upset, there's something bothering you that you
need to pay attention to.  We both know you
dislike your job and that you stay on mainly
because you're afraid of a change.  We can talk a
long time about your unhappiness at work and
about your fear of change, but eventually it will be
time to stop talking and to try some alternatives.
Do you think you're ready?  I think you are.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
CLIENT: (Sighs.) I guess you're right.  I seem to be dragging
my feet.  If I want a satisfying job, I'm just going to
have to try something else.  Can we talk about
some of my alternatives, then, and I'll try to stop
complaining!
</p>

<p class="quote2">
THERAPIST: [Now she's starting to face up to the challenge.]
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF EXISTENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
These are some of the difficulties existential psychotherapy is
designed to treat:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* feelings of <i>real estrangement or alienation</i> from
others&mdash;from your immediate family and friends or from neighbors
or colleagues at work
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* a sense of <i>acute loneliness</i>, of being cut off from humanity
and from normal everyday activities and interactions
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* an awareness that your life has become an <i>empty pattern</i>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
of habit, that your activities or work no longer feel
meaningful or valuable
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* an inability to <i>accept</i> the realities that limit life; for
example, anxiety experienced by older persons as they
become more aware of the need to face the reality that life
will end or anger and frustration experienced by
individuals who must cope with real limitations&mdash;persons
with physical impairments and chronic pain, individuals
whose opportunities are limited by poverty, by their ties of
responsibility to others, or by social disadvantage
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Individuals who benefit most from existential psychotherapy
tend to have these characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are reflective and analytical.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They tend to be introverted.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have <i>lost faith</i>&mdash;in their sense of social commitment,
in their identity and role within their families, in their
belief that their work is of value, or in their religion.

PSYCHOTHERAPY, PART II
<br /><br />
  Logotherapy, Reality Therapy<br />
  Adlerian Therapy,<br />
  Emotional Flooding Therapies,<br />
  Direct Decision Therapy<br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
In this second chapter devoted to major approaches to psychotherapy,
we will look at logotherapy, reality therapy, Adlerian
therapy, the family of emotional flooding therapies, and direct
decision therapy.  Like the five psychotherapies described in
Chapter 10, these focus special attention on a client's personal
style of relating to the world and others.  They all seek to help a
person to free himself or herself from troubling feelings and
negative attitudes and to replace these with a stronger and more
confident self-concept.  Each therapy is a different path to that
goal.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

LOGOTHERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For reflective individuals who are sensitive to<br />
  values and who are in search of a richer sense<br />
  of meaning in life.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
He who has a <i>why</i> to live for can bear with almost any <i>how</i>.
<br /><br />
Friedrich Nietzsche
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
</p>

<p>
Viktor Frankl (1905-1997) is worthy of much respect and
admiration.  Out of three terrible years of suffering in a
concentration camp, during which his mother, father, brother, and wife
were taken from him, Dr. Frankl developed logotherapy (from
the Greek <i>logos</i>, roughly equivalent to "meaning").  Logotherapy
is an approach to therapy that addresses our inherent need for
meaning and value in living.  The belief that sustained Dr. Frankl
during this period of intense suffering was the conviction that
people, in spite of great adversity, anguish, and the loss of all they
hold dear, can remain free within themselves and are able to
maintain, and even to strengthen, their sense of self-respect and
integrity.  To communicate how it is possible to do this became
Dr. Frankl's lifework.
</p>

<p>
Logotherapy is a therapy of meaning for those who are unable
to find a reason for living.  It is a form of therapy related to
existential analysis (see Chapter 10), but it is specific in its
concern for helping clients find what it is that really matters to
them, that makes hardships and pain worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
If Freudian psychoanalysis looks to the past for insight, logotherapy
focuses instead on the future, on a person's <i>life task</i>.  In
this, there is no abstract and general answer to the question
"What is the meaning of life?"
</p>

<p class="quote2">
For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to
day and from hour to hour.  What matters, therefore, is not the
meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a
person's life at a given moment.  To put the question in general
terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess
master, "Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?"
There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move
apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular
personality of one's opponent.  The same holds for human
existence....  Everyone has his own specific vocation or
mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment
that demands fulfillment....  Ultimately, a man should not ask
what the meaning of life is, but rather must recognize that it is
he who is asked.  In a word, each man is questioned by life; and
he can only answer to life by <i>answering for</i> his own life; to life
he can only respond by being responsible.[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]

Dr. Frankl liked to compare logotherapy to the role of the eye
specialist: the logotherapist's role is to help the patient see more
clearly the range of lived values and meaning available to him.

<p class="t3">
WHAT LOGOTHERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
An elderly physician came to Viktor Frankl to ask for help with
severe depression.  His wife, whom he loved above all else, had
died two years before.  His sense of loss would not heal.  Could
Dr. Frankl help him?
</p>

<p>
Dr. Frankl responded with a question: "What would have
happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife had had to
survive you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said, "for her this would have been terrible; how she
would have suffered!"
</p>

<p>
"You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it
is you who have spared her this suffering; but now, you have to
pay for it by surviving and mourning her."
</p>

<p>
The physician said nothing, but rose to his feet, shook Dr. Frankl's
hand, and calmly left his office.  "Suffering ceases to be
suffering in some way at the moment it finds a meaning, such as
the meaning of sacrifice."[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>]  It is the basic concern of logotherapy
to help patients see the meaning in their lives.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn2text">2</a>] Frankl, <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>, pp. 178-179.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Logotherapy is known for two techniques endorsed by Viktor
Frankl.  He called them <i>dereflection</i> and <i>paradoxical intention</i>.
</p>

<p>
Many emotional problems have their roots in what psychotherapists
call <i>anticipatory anxiety</i>: a woman who is afraid of
blushing when she enters a room filled with people will tend to
blush.  A man who fears impotence and who tries to achieve an
erection will often fail.  A woman who willfully tries to achieve
orgasm also will frequently fail.  These are examples of excessive,
or hyper-, reflection.  Excessive, anxious attention is paid to what
we fear or wish, bringing about the very thing we are trying to
avoid.
</p>

<p>
Frankl developed specific ways of refocusing or rechanneling
this excessive attention.  <i>Dereflection</i> could take the form, for
example, of persuading the blushing woman to concentrate on
particular things when she enters a crowded room: to look for
acquaintances, to admire what someone may be wearing, or to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
look for objects in the room to appreciate, for example.  In the
case of impotence or frigidity, often a shift of attention from
yourself to your partner's pleasure will eliminate anticipatory
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Frankl describes an attempt to help a bookkeeper who was in
real despair and close to suicide.  For several years he had
suffered from writer's cramp: very real muscular cramps that
reduced his legible script to an illegible scrawl.  He was in danger
of losing his job.
</p>

<p>
He was treated with <i>paradoxical intention</i>.  He was asked to
write in an intentionally illegible scrawl.  But he found that when
he deliberately tried to scrawl, he could not.  Within two days, his
writer's cramp had vanished.  Similar approaches have been very
effective&mdash;and long-lasting&mdash;in certain cases of severe stuttering,
uncontrolled shaking, washing compulsions, insomnia, sexual
difficulties, and other problems.
</p>

<p>
Logotherapists tend to be warm, accepting individuals.  They
will often use humor.  Yet they are trained to confront individuals:
to push their clients to face their inner feelings of futility and
despair, and then, out of their often overlooked and underestimated
inner resources and moral strength, to <i>will</i> that their lives
become meaningful.  Logotherapists try to encourage clients to
see more clearly what it is that gives them a sense of value in
living and to use what they see to direct themselves toward more
satisfying and personally fulfilling lives.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF LOGOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
As we have already observed, logotherapy has been used to
treat a wide range of individual problems involving a loss of faith
in the value of living, behavior that no longer is under voluntary
control, or behavior that frustrates your desires.
</p>

<p>
Logotherapy is especially well-suited to helping individuals
with <i>noÃ¶genic neuroses</i>, Frankl's term for personal problems
that have their basis in conflicts between opposing values.
NoÃ¶genic (from the Greek <i>nous</i>, meaning "spirit" or "mind")
neuroses have their origin in personal moral or spiritual, but not
necessarily religious, conflicts.  They lead to a feeling of
existential frustration: a person's will to find meaning is blocked.  When
sufficient pressure is built up, anxiety and depression can follow.
You can imagine how pressure might build up in the inner lives
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
of a business executive who wishes she had a family instead of a
career identity, a university professor who yearns to be an independent artist,
or a financially successful businessman who despises his own
pretenses and opportunism.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
I asked the poor creatures who listened to me attentively in the

REALITY THERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For persons able to make a commitment to a<br />
  plan for life improvement, whether they have<br />
  emotional or behavioral problems or simply<br />
  want to develop a success-identity.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
... [U]nhappiness is the result and not the cause of irresponsibility.
<br /><br />
William Glasser, <i>Reality Therapy</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Reality therapy was developed in the 1950s by psychiatrist
William Glasser (1925-2013).  His approach to therapy evolved
as a result of his work with delinquent teenage girls, with clients
in private practice, and with severely troubled patients in a VA
hospital.
</p>

<p>
Reality therapy, as the name implies, attempts to help by
strengthening a person's practical understanding of reality and
by encouraging concrete planning that will bring about an
improved sense of personal adjustment to reality.  It emphasizes
a very practical, feet-on-the-ground focus on the present: a
person's past experience cannot be rewritten.  Reality therapists
do not believe in the essential value of psychoanalytic interpretation,
dream analysis, nondirective counseling, or intellectual
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
insight.  A reality therapist focuses on the present, specifically on
attempts patients may now be making to become more successful
<i>from their own points of view</i>.  If a patient is not able to make
definite plans of this kind and cannot sustain a commitment to
them, the focus of reality therapy will be to encourage the
patient to begin to do this.  It is an approach that believes that a
strong sense of personal identity can come only from <i>doing</i>: if an
individual is able to develop a degree of self-responsibility that is
solid and enterprising, a feeling of personal success and
effectiveness will follow.
</p>

<p>
Reality therapists are opposed to making diagnoses.  A diagnostic
label frequently adds a burden to individuals who are already
burdened by emotional, family, or adjustment problems.  Glasser
notes, for example, that being labeled a schizophrenic "can be
worse than the disease as far as incapacitating one in the course
of life's activities."[<a id="chap11fn4text"></a><a href="#chap11fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn4text">4</a>] William Glasser and Leonard M. Zunin, "Reality Therapy,"
in Raymond J. Corsini, ed.,
<i>Current Psychotherapies</i> (Itasca, IL: F. E. Peacock Publishers, 1979),
p. 329.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Reality therapists can resist diagnosing and labeling their
clients because their approach claims that personal psychological
difficulties, except those due to physical illness (see Chapter
8), result from a lack of personal discipline and responsibility.
People are often caught in the habit of blaming their failures on
their families, their lack of opportunity, their race, poverty, and
other outside forces.  It is a habit with a dead end: it ignores the
potential success that can come from initiative motivated by
responsibility and moral courage.  As Ernest Hemingway said
when asked if he ever anticipated failure, "If you anticipate
failure, you'll have it."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE EXPERIENCE OF REALITY THERAPY
</p>

<p>
It isn't hard to gain a feeling for what reality therapy is like.
These are the basic principles of the approach:
</p>

<p>
The relationship between therapist and client must be personal.
The therapist tries to make clear that he is a genuine
person who has, in some areas of his life, been able to plan
effectively and to develop a sense of personal success.
</p>

<p>
The focus of individual sessions is on what the client <i>does</i>, not
on what he or she may <i>feel</i>.  Behavior can be changed much more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
directly than feelings, and feelings soon fall into place once
behavior is more satisfying.  What is important is for the client to
develop intelligent plans and then to work to carry them
through.  If certain goals are not realized, the therapist's concern
is to encourage the client to take the next practical step, rather
than to spend time and energy analyzing what went wrong.
</p>

<p>
The reality therapist accepts that the first steps are often
halting ones.  It is important not to be disconcerted by occasional
stumbling and a few falls.  What is essential is a commitment
to self-discipline and progress, refusing to punish yourself
when a plan may not succeed, but going beyond it with a positive
attitude that eventually can become a habit.
</p>

<p>
Glasser gives this illustration of the persistent refocusing on
practical issues that characterizes reality therapy: a teenage girl
expresses to her therapist that she would like to look for a job.
The therapist does not respond, "Good, let me know how it
works out," but instead begins the following exchange.[<a id="chap11fn5text"></a><a href="#chap11fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p class="quote2">
  THERAPIST:  What day next week?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIRL:  I don't know.  I thought Monday or Tuesday.<br />
  THERAPIST:  Which day?  Monday or Tuesday?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIRL:  Well, I guess Tuesday.<br />
  THERAPIST:  You guess, or will it be Tuesday?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIRL:  Tuesday.<br />
  THERAPIST:  What time Tuesday?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIRL:  Well, sometime in the morning.<br />
  THERAPIST:  What time in the morning?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIRL:  Oh, well, 9:30.<br />
  THERAPIST:  Fine, that is a good time to begin looking for a job.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you plan to wear?<br />
</p>

<i>Current Psychotherapies</i>, p. 324.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In another example of reality therapy, a patient says, "I feel
depressed and miserable."  Instead of responding, "How long
have you felt this way?" or "What have you been feeling
depressed about?," a reality therapist might ask, "What have you
been doing that continues to make you depressed?" or "Why
aren't you even <i>more</i> depressed?"  With both of these responses,
the therapist makes it clear that he believes the client can
influence his or her feelings.
</p>

<p>
Often therapists, no matter what their approach, will say to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
clients who are going through a difficult time that they may
phone after hours if there is an emergency.  A reality therapist
may, in addition, also say, "I hope you'll call me if you have had
a special success."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF REALITY THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Reality therapy has been used in connection with these types
of problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* individual problems involving anxiety, marital conflicts,
maladjustment, and some psychoses where a person is
comparatively out of touch with reality and may have
hallucinations or delusions
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* teenage delinquency
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* difficulties faced by women who have recently been
widowed
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* designing school programs that stress the development of
individual identity based on a sense of personal success
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Reality therapists believe that their approach is of value to
people who want to develop a more successful pattern of living,
of managing their own affairs, and of coping effectively with
challenges at work and with problems of everyday living.  Reality
therapy has also been used in industry with organizational
problems and with difficulties experienced by individual
employees.
</p>

<p>
Reality therapy is not useful in treating problems in which
there is severe withdrawal (as in autism) or cases involving
serious mental retardation.  To be effective, reality therapy
presupposes that clients are able to communicate and are both
willing and able to cultivate habits of self-discipline and
personal responsibility.

ADLERIAN PSYCHOTHERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For individuals interested in personal growth,<br />
  especially in social directions, and for persons<br />
  with low self-esteem who feel blocked and<br />
  discouraged about life.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote2">
The greatest principle of living is to love one's neighbor as
oneself.
<br /><br />
Rabbi Akiva, writing 2,000 years ago
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Alfred Adler (1870-1937) was a contemporary of Freud.  Early
in his career, Adler was invited by Freud to participate in his
special circle of professionals interested in the development of
psychoanalysis.  Adler's already formulated views were not in
accord with Freud's, their differences became more pronounced,
and Adler eventually separated himself from psychoanalysis.
Freud was embittered and became a lifelong enemy of
Adler.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to Freud's technical and abstract theory, Adler's is
humanistic, open, and concrete.  Where Freudian analysis
believes that emotional disturbances have a sexual basis, Adlerian
therapy claims that neurosis comes about through distorted
perceptions and from habits and attitudes that are <i>learned</i>.  In
Adler's system of <i>individual psychology</i>, there is no concern for
unconscious processes or for internal divisions of the self into id,
superego, and ego.  Adlerians stress that a person forms a unity
and must be treated as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Adler's approach to psychotherapy is based on the view that
feelings of inferiority are normal.  They exist in children, and
they continue to be present in adults who may feel weak
psychologically, socially, or because of physical limitations.  To
compensate for feelings of inferiority, adults strive for superiority
by dealing effectively with the world, or they become deeply
discouraged (however, they are not considered to be "sick")
and lose contact with positive, constructive activities.
</p>

<p>
Adler also postulated that emotional difficulties come about
when you are convinced that you simply cannot solve the
problems of life in a way that is compatible with a need to be
superior in some way.  Certain attempts to compensate for
feelings of inferiority can lead to emotional problems later.  They
include seeking a feeling of superiority by requiring attention
from others, striving for power over others, taking revenge, and
giving up&mdash;declaring that you cannot cope because of personal
deficiencies and weakness.  Children from families where there is
distrust, domination, abuse, or neglect tend to choose these
paths.
</p>

<p>
Another facet of Adler's approach is that individuals who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
cannot compensate for feelings of inferiority are inclined to
make a number of "basic mistakes" in perceiving the world.  They
will overgeneralize ("Nobody cares about me."), depreciate
their worth ("I'm just a housewife."), set unrealistic goals ("I
should please everyone."), distort ("You have to lie to get
ahead."), and hold faulty values ("Win, even if you have to climb
over others.").
</p>

<p>
Finally, Adler felt that, over the course of their lives, many
people strengthen these basic mistakes while in pursuit of the
ultimately unsatisfying desires for attention, power, revenge, or
escape.  Their styles of living may lead to depression, chronic
anxiety, crime, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other problems.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT ADLERIAN THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Adlerian therapists try to help people change unfulfilling
patterns of living in several ways.
</p>

<p>
First, and perhaps most important, is the belief that therapy
should do more than help clients with immediate problems.  It
should help them develop an adequate philosophy of life,
encourage them to cultivate an approach to living that is
self-sustaining, positive, and inherently <i>social</i> in focus.  The paradox
of inferiority and low self-esteem is that the suffering they cause
disappears once people can forget themselves and begin living to
some extent for others.  Adler would remind his clients to
"consider from time to time how you can give another person
pleasure."[<a id="chap11fn6text"></a><a href="#chap11fn6">6</a>]  Adlerian therapy stresses the importance of social
goals.  For Adler, we are foremost social creatures; our individual
identities can be developed and our problems resolved only in a
social context.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn6"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn6text">6</a>] Alfred Adler, <i>Problems of Neurosis</i>
(New York: Harper and Row, 1964), p. 101.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Since Adler believed that most emotional difficulties we
experience result from feelings of inferiority that have led to
discouragement, the second goal of Adlerian therapists is to offer
<i>encouragement</i>.  They are as much concerned with mirroring
clients' strengths as they are with analyzing their problems.
Adlerian therapists will devote a good deal of attention to
identifying and encouraging the personal assets of each client.
</p>

<p>
Adler suggested several techniques that have also come to be
used by other schools of psychotherapy:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Acting "As If"</i>
</p>

<p>
Frequently, clients express a wish to begin acting in new
ways&mdash;to be more assertive, to make an effort to break out of
confining patterns of living, to conquer certain fears.  However,
they usually feel that the new behaviors are phony, so they are
reluctant to try.  Adler suggested that clients try a new behavior
for the next week only as they would try on new clothing: they
need only act <i>as if</i>.  Adler found that, as clients began to act
differently, they would begin to feel differently.  When their
feelings were positive, they tended to make new ways of behaving
part of themselves.  (Behavior modification, described in the
next chapter, builds on this idea.)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Paradoxical Intention</i>
</p>

<p>
We encountered this technique, also called <i>negative practice</i>,
in the preceding section on logotherapy.  It can be a very
effective technique when certain habits can no longer be
controlled.  If you suffered from insomnia, you would be asked to
focus your attention on staying awake: to put an end to the habit,
you would be asked to amplify it.  Oddly enough, in many cases,
this judo-like dropping of resistance and redirection of attention
can bring involuntary behavior back under control.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Push-Button Technique</i>
</p>

<p>
Many of us have unpleasant thoughts and emotions that refuse
to leave us.  We find ourselves on familiar tracks that we know
lead to sadness, regret, anger, panic, or frustration.  But we can't
seem to subdue what Zen calls "these chattering monkeys of the
mind."  Adler taught clients that they <i>could</i> create whatever
feelings in themselves they wished, simply by deciding what to
think.  It is possible, with some practice, to imagine a happy or
peaceful memory or scene and to direct your attention to it
when negative thoughts try to dominate.  We all have this push
button available.  Like all exercises in self-discipline, it
strengthens us the more we use it.  (Cognitive therapy, discussed in
Chapter 10, is especially concerned with this influence of
thoughts on emotions.)
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SETTINGS FOR THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Adlerians use a variety of settings for therapy.  Individual
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
therapy is common, but sometimes two therapists may work
together with one client, an approach that gives clients an
experience of cooperation between professionals who may
perceive them differently.  Adlerian workshops are popular with
parents concerned with problems in rearing children.  Other
workshops exist for married couples.  Adlerians have often been
innovative: Rudolf Dreikurs, a well-known student of Adler, was,
for example, one of the first therapists to use group therapy in
private practice.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF ADLERIAN PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
Because Adler did not view human problems as forms of
sickness, Adlerians see emotional and behavioral difficulties as
blocks that people encounter in their attempts to realize
themselves.  Many of the problems Adlerian therapists treat are
therefore considered to be <i>normal</i> problems of living faced by
<i>normal</i> people.  Many clients enter therapy to learn about
themselves and to grow.
</p>

<p>
Adlerians have worked with a wide range of clients with a wide
range of human problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* clients interested in personal development
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* individuals who have become deeply discouraged about
their lives
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* couples and families
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* delinquents and criminals
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
EMOTIONAL FLOODING THERAPIES
</p>

<p>
Today there are three main varieties of emotional flooding
therapies: bioenergetics, primal therapy, and implosive therapy.
They share the central belief that, by taxing you, pushing you to
experience frustration, anger, or anxiety, the therapist may help
you achieve a lasting sense of emotional relief and well-being.
</p>

<p>
These three therapies do, however, vary a good deal in the
techniques they use to encourage clients to experience strong
emotions.  Bioenergetics makes use of an unusual approach to
physical exercise.  Primal therapy encourages clients to relive
early painful memories.  Implosive therapy asks clients to use
imagery to increase, in a controlled manner, feelings that cause
emotional distress.  These approaches share the assumption that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
emotional difficulties can be helped by a direct release of
feelings that have come to be blocked.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
BIOENERGETICS
<br /><br />
  <i>For rigid, inhibited people who have pent-up<br />
  feelings in need of release.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Alexander Lowen (1910-2008) was trained as a physician and
then as a psychoanalyst under the direction of Austrian
psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957).  Reich believed that
emotional problems resulted from sexual repression.  He was a social
revolutionary in his attempts to bring about sexual freedom.  He
became a controversial figure and was not able to put his ideas
on a serious and professionally respectable footing.
</p>

<p>
Lowen was interested in the therapeutic implications of
Reich's work.  He developed an approach to therapy that emphasizes
not sexual liberation and pleasure as Reich did, but a sense
of freedom that he felt could result only from an approach to the
body that allows you to drop tense muscular armor and to feel
integrated and fully alive.  Lowen found that emotionally
troubled people were physically knotted and rigid and tended to
breathe in a shallow and constricted way.
</p>

<p>
Lowen devised a variety of physical exercises, such as holding
your body in an arched position until exhaustion sets in, making
contact with the floor only with hands, head, and feet.  These
exercises can cause enough stress to arouse intense emotions:
crying out, collapsing, feeling rage or tenderness.  As these
pent-up feelings are released, many clients often discover an increase
in positive emotional strength.
</p>

<p>
Bioenergetic therapists offer individual therapy as well as
workshops.  They tend to act as teachers, pointing out very
bluntly how a client's physical rigidities reflect rigid qualities of
personality: "Your chest muscles are this tense because you have
been defending yourself so long, like a boxer," or "Your jaw
muscles ache because you've been biting back angry impulses."
</p>

<p>
Because of its physical approach to human emotions, bioenergetics
is sometimes regarded as the West's therapeutic version of
yoga.  (For a discussion of yoga, see Chapter 15.)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Applications of Bioenergetics</i>
</p>

<p>
Bioenergetics appears to be most useful for people with any of
these characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Their feelings are markedly inhibited, or they feel
deadened emotionally.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They feel impaired sexually or do not experience orgasm
for nonphysical reasons.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are rigid, uptight, and inclined to be obsessive
perfectionists.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have pent-up feelings of anger, hostility, or grief that
are in need of an outlet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Bioenergetics is not the treatment of choice when deeper
insight and self-knowledge are important.  Bioenergetic
therapists are not in general especially concerned with a client's
personal history, family and work environment, or specific
adaptation problems.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
PRIMAL THERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For individuals who continue to suffer from<br />
  childhood pain.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Arthur Janov (1924- ) was psychoanalytically trained as a
clinical psychologist and psychiatric social worker.  He had been
practicing for seventeen years when a shy and withdrawn client
in a group therapy session let out a piercing, primitive scream.
The inhibited client experienced a sense of release and insight.
This event fascinated Janov and eventually transformed his
professional perspective.
</p>

<p>
He developed an approach to therapy that encourages patients
to re-experience repressed painful memories from childhood.
Janov calls these <i>primal</i> pains: they come about when a child's
emotional needs repeatedly are not met.  The inner suffering that
results is suppressed; the pain cannot be dissipated.  It takes
energy to continue to block out painful feelings.  The constant
expenditure of energy then shows up in conscious tension.  Janov
came to believe that emotional problems in adults stem from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
their unwillingness to experience feelings that a child would
find crushing but&mdash;though painful&mdash;can now be faced.  When
primal pain is faced, Janov claims, individuals gain a degree of
freedom and maturity they could not otherwise achieve.
</p>

<p>
Janov's primal therapy is best known for the "primal scream"
we mentioned above that some patients let out when they
confront the pain they have suppressed for so long.  Primal
therapy encourages a repeated cathartic release of pent-up
feelings.  During the first three critical weeks of therapy (which
normally cost in excess of $2,000), the primal therapist is on call
twenty-four hours a day for a single patient.  The patient is
isolated for the first week in a hotel room, without TV,
cigarettes, alcohol, sex, or companionship, and has daily therapy
sessions with the therapist that last from two to three-and-a-half
hours.  Patients then spend six to twelve months in a primal
therapy group.
</p>

<p>
Janov has been criticized for his apparent desire for public
charisma and for capitalizing on advertising hype.  He tends not
to reveal in writing details of his procedures in therapy and will
share his professional secrets only with initiates at his primal
therapy institute.  Comparatively few therapists have had this
special training.  However, many therapists offer what they claim
is the equivalent of primal therapy, which they call <i>intensive
feeling therapy</i>.  They have the same format for therapy: isolation
in a hotel room, three weeks' exclusive attention to each client,
and the resulting high fees.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Applications of Primal Therapy</i>
</p>

<p>
Primal therapy has been used to treat these problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* chronic depression and anxiety
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* compulsions
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* phobias
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* drug addiction
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems of homosexuals
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* marital problems
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Like bioenergetics, primal therapy is best suited for individuals
who have repressed or pent-up feelings they have not found
ways to release.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is important to bear in mind that primal therapy is initially
one of the most expensive therapies, since it devotes exclusive
attention to each client at the beginning of therapy.  It may not be
the therapy of choice for more verbal, intellectual clients who
want to develop an understanding of themselves beyond an
experience of catharsis.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IMPLOSIVE THERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For people with phobias.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This emotional flooding therapy was developed by Thomas
Stampfl (1923- ).  Stampfl was trained as a clinical psychologist
at Loyola of Chicago and was influenced by both psychoanalysis
and the psychology of learning.  Early in his career, he
became convinced that clients with phobias tend to reinforce
their fears by automatically avoiding what they fear.  He developed
an approach to help people face the situations, feelings, or
memories they most fear.
</p>

<p>
Stampfl's approach is most easily understood in the light of
recent experimental work on animal avoidance behavior.  A dog,
for example, is confined in a cage that is divided in two.  A low
wall separates the two halves of the cage, over which the dog can
jump.  On one side there is a bell that rings just before the dog
receives an electric shock.  The dog promptly learns that he can
avoid the shock by jumping to the other side of the cage.  Soon he
will learn to do this automatically, whenever the bell rings.  What
is significant from a psychologist's point of view is that the dog
will continue for a long time to jump to the opposite side of the
cage, even once no further shocks are given.  The dog's fear is
maintained in force only by his own memory.
</p>

<p>
Animal psychologists have found a quick way to end the dog's
fear: ring the bell, but <i>prevent</i> the dog from jumping to the other
side of the cage.  Once the anxiety-stricken animal realizes that
he is no longer going to be shocked, the old habit based on fear
simply disappears.
</p>

<p>
Implosive therapists make use of an equivalent technique with
human beings.  Patients are asked to imagine, as vividly as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
possible, that they are facing the very thing they chronically have
tried to avoid.  For example, an individual may have suffered from
a terrifying fear of elevators for years.  The therapist tries to use
exaggerated imagery to produce maximum anxiety.  He might ask
the patient to imagine being stuck in an elevator fifty floors up,
having the elevator shake and abruptly fall a foot, then have the
lights go out, and so on.  By <i>maintaining</i> this contrived elevator
nightmare long enough, implosive therapists claim that, frequently,
the level of anxiety of patients quickly and dramatically
falls, and they lose their exaggerated fears.
</p>

<p>
Implosive therapists are therefore not primarily concerned
with being genuine, sympathetic, or mothering.  They focus their
energy and attention on pushing clients to confront the worst
fears and catastrophes they can imagine.  All the while, clients are
aware both that the intense anxiety they experience is an
<i>intended</i> goal of therapy and that the therapist is convinced they
are much stronger than they have thought.
</p>

<p>
Implosive therapy is usually done on an individual basis and is
comparatively brief, usually lasting less than a dozen sessions.  It
should be mentioned that, when not successful, implosive therapy
may occasionally <i>sensitize</i> clients to feel even more anxiety
than they did at the outset.  It therefore tends to be a higher-risk
treatment, but it can be remarkably effective.  Visualizing
anxiety-producing events also has successfully been used by
individuals on their own.  (For more information, see "Appendix B:
Suggestions for Further Reading.")
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Applications of Implosive Therapy</i>
</p>

<p>
Implosive therapy is especially appropriate for the treatment
of phobic individuals who characteristically tend to avoid
certain kinds of behavior, situations, or objects because of the
severe anxiety and agitation these produce in them.  Implosive
therapy, when effective, can be dramatically effective in a
comparatively short time.  However, less arduous approaches to
therapy can often be as effective and may involve less risk of
increasing a client's existing anxiety.  Alternative short-term
therapies especially well-suited to the treatment of phobias
include behavior modification (Chapter 12), Gestalt therapy
(Chapter 10), reality therapy (earlier in this chapter), primal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
therapy (earlier in this chapter), and biofeedback, relaxation
training, and hypnosis (Chapter 15).

DIRECT DECISION THERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For individuals capable of exercising<br />
  determination and self-discipline who<br />
  earnestly desire to change.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
[I]f there's one thing my experience as a psychotherapist has
taught me, it is that no one has to be a victim.  However
important external factors like health, physical appearance,
and upbringing may be, they don't have to determine the
happiness quotient in anyone's life story.  The way we
experience our lives is, quite simply, up to us.
<br /><br />
Harold Greenwald, <i>The Happy Person</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, the majority of academic and research psychologists regard
themselves basically as Freudians.  Yet most psychiatrists,
psychotherapists, social workers, and counselors have moved beyond
Freud's formal categories and made use of their own common
sense and interpretive abilities.  Harold Greenwald's emphasis
on the central role of <i>choice</i> in making fundamental life decisions
implicitly represents the approach of a great many therapists and counselors
today.  His conception of therapy is
casual, simple, and often good-humored.
</p>

<p>
Greenwald (1910-2011) was originally trained as a psychoanalyst.
As Greenwald gained professional experience, however,
his perspective began to change.  He gradually came to believe
that many patients had, at some critical moment, made a <i>decision</i>
to "go crazy."  There was a point when they could exercise
control, and at that moment, they chose to be depressed or
anxious, to withdraw completely into catatonia, to become
schizophrenic, alcoholic, or whatever their decision might be.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
I discovered in working with people who have had psychotic
breaks ... that most of them described a particular moment
when there was a choice of whether to stay in control or let go....
You will find, again and again, if you speak to patients who
have broken down, and if you search for it, that there is always
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
a point at which they had a choice, and it is at that point that
they still have the possibility of controlling themselves.  If they
have confidence in their ability to control themselves they can
exercise it.[<a id="chap11fn7text"></a><a href="#chap11fn7">7</a>]

This <i>choice point</i> that people experience became the focus of
Dr. Greenwald's direct decision therapy.

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
AN EXAMPLE
</p>

<p>
Here is one of the most dramatic examples of his approach:
Dr. Greenwald had been invited to give a demonstration of direct
decision therapy at a mental hospital in Norway.  He asked for a
volunteer from the inmates, someone who could speak English.
A twenty-year-old patient named Marie came forward.  She had
the appearance of a back ward schizophrenic.  She was haggard,
wild-eyed, and unkempt.  Here is Dr. Greenwald's description of
their opening conversation:[<a id="chap11fn8text"></a><a href="#chap11fn8">8</a>]

<p class="quote">
I gestured toward a chair.  "Won't you sit down, please?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"When I'm ready.  I'll sit when I'm ready."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Would you tell me your name?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
She waved an arm toward the staff member seated behind me.
"You heard him.  Marie, my name is MARIE!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I'm sorry, Marie, I didn't catch it at first.  Now I wonder if
there is anything I can do for you.  Would you like me to help
you?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"You can't help me, none of you can help me.  Why don't you

</p>

<p class="quote">
She rushed on, shouting at the top of her voice and using a
mixture of expletives and obscenities that showed an admirable
command of English as well as Norwegian.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Nothing I could do could make the situation worse, so I
decided to try something drastic.  I outshouted her.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"CUT IT OUT, MARIE!  YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TALK LIKE THAT."
</p>

<p class="quote">
She stopped suddenly and focused on me for the first time.
The muscles in her face relaxed ever so slightly, and her eyes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
showed awareness and intelligence.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"How'd you know?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
I stared at her for a minute, giving her my best foxy-grandpa
look.  "It takes one to know one," I said finally&mdash;at which point
Marie's face broke into a grin.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"You mean <i>you're</i> crazy?  You too?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Perhaps.  And perhaps the only difference between you and
me is that I know how to act sane."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Marie seemed to like the sound of that.  She tightened the
sash of her bathrobe and sat down.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As Marie calmed down, she agreed that she would like Dr. Greenwald
to help her.  She wanted badly to leave the institution.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DR. G.: If you really want to get out, Marie, you'll have to make a
very simple decision.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MARIE: What's that?
</p>

<p class="quote">
DR. G: Decide to act sane.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dr. Greenwald asked her to think of the benefits, the payoffs,
that came to her as a result of her crazy behavior.  There were a
number of major payoffs: she didn't have to look after herself,
didn't have to look for a job, didn't have to listen to her mother.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that Marie decided to give up being crazy and
to return to everyday living.  It would have been easy for
Dr. Greenwald to conclude that she had been faking all the years she
was in the mental institution.  But she had not been play-acting.
Yet her illness began through a <i>choice</i> she had made, and it
ended the same way.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the hospital world was not easy for her.  In fact, it was
often very difficult.  But she stayed with her decision and often
had to reaffirm it.  She married and had a child.  She wrote to Dr.
Greenwald:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
I found myself beginning to drift off, drift out of my life, the
way I used to.  And&mdash;I didn't!  I decided to be the kind of
person, the kind of wife and mother, that I want to be.  Not
perfect, just what's possible.  And if I drift off, I won't be able to
hear my daughter, I'll be just like my mother was with me.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Marie went back to school and earned a degree in psychology.
After her experience, she was, she felt (as did Dr. Greenwald), in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
a special position to be helpful to other people in suffering.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT DIRECT DECISION THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p class="quote2">
On your own or with professional help, the truth about
you&mdash;whoever you are&mdash;is that you carry within yourself the
resources to heal your most grievous pains, overcome your most
paralyzing fears, devise ingenious solutions to your most
burdensome problems.
<br /><br />
Harold Greenwald, <i>The Happy Person</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
During the first session with a client, Dr. Greenwald often says
something like, "Do you want me to concentrate on your
problems, or would you like us to work together in making you
happy?"  Immediately, he suggests to clients that in fact they are
able to change and become happier.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Greenwald describes seven phases that direct decision
therapy involves:
</p>

<p class="point">
1. Decide what you want in order to be happy (or happier).
</p>

<p class="point">
2. Find the decision behind the problem: what has your
implicit decision been in your life that has established an
unhappy, or less happy, pattern?  Greenwald calls these <i>life
decisions</i>: they form the center around which you organize
your life.  They are responsible for your attitudes,
perceptions, what you value most, and your behavior.
</p>

<p class="point">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your life decision is to suffer, you will interpret
everything that happens to you as more suffering-to-be-endured.
If you are praised, you may question whether the
praise has an ulterior motive.  "Sufferers ... have the ability
to snatch disaster from every victory."[<a id="chap11fn9text"></a><a href="#chap11fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p class="point">
3. When was the original decision made?  Did your life
decision come from your upbringing?  Did you inherit it from
your parents?
</p>

<p class="point">
4. Identify the payoffs for the decision.  Even extreme
unhappiness&mdash;chronic clinical depression&mdash;can have real payoffs:
release you from responsibilities, gain you attention from
others, allow you to return to the comfort of childhood
dependency, etc.  Anxiety can give you good reasons for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
disqualifying yourself from stressful situations and
reinforce your belief that you cannot cope.
</p>

<p class="point">
5. What are your alternatives to the behavior that is causing a
problem?  It is often hard to see that you are <i>not</i> really
trapped in a state of unhappiness.  There are always
alternatives.
</p>

<p class="point">
6. Choose your alternative and put it into practice.  Trust
yourself.  "[H]appy people have a sense that whatever
happens, things will eventually work out.  In short, they
trust themselves to react in their own best interest."[<a id="chap11fn10text"></a><a href="#chap11fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p class="point">
7. Support yourself in carrying out your decision.  Habits die
slowly.  You must be patient.  Your decision has to be made
over and over again, just as an overweight person who loves
food must decide again and again to say "No" to this dessert
today, the baked potato tomorrow.  Gradually, the strength
of your decision builds as <i>you</i> build strength into it.

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF DIRECT DECISION THERAPY
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, direct decision therapy is based on the
assumption that you are <i>able</i> to begin to exercise self-discipline
and that you are <i>willing</i> to give up the real payoffs that being
emotionally troubled frequently does achieve.
</p>

<p>
These interrelated things&mdash;ability and willingness to change&mdash;simply
are not present in many people who enter therapy.  They
come to therapy for a variety of other, often unconscious,
reasons: for temporary comforting, for escape from an upsetting
situation or environment, or for a chance to release painful
feelings and to express painful thoughts.  Clients come in order
to procrastinate; they come to prove to themselves that they
simply <i>can't</i> change and that the therapist just isn't good enough.
They come out of anger, frustration, despair.  But comparatively
few enter therapy because they really are persuaded they <i>can</i>
change and are committed to bringing change about.
</p>

<p>
These people are unquestionably the most promising candidates
for <i>any</i> approach to psychotherapy.  Clients who come to
therapy for other reasons make up the daily challenge and the
daily frustration, concern, worry, and hope of the therapist.  The
therapist believes that, in time, and with proper treatment,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
people who are imprisoned within walls of their own habits can
rally the determination and faith to tear them down and to gain
a measure of personal freedom.
</p>

<p>
In this author's judgment, direct decision therapy, perhaps
more than any other approach, relies on a client's determination
and perseverance.  If these personality qualities are there, or if
they can successfully be encouraged by a good therapist, the
approach can be effective with a very wide range of problems.
</p>

Many of us today feel forced to adapt to ways of living that will
lead to unhappiness, loneliness, fear, and illness.  Is unlocking all
five bolts on one's apartment door in the morning, checking that
the can of Mace is in your purse, joining the sidewalk crowd to
the subway, hoping you are not mugged (or worse), and then
spending the daylight hours in a windowless office, in an
atmosphere of tension, pressure, competitiveness, and cigarette

respond especially to present needs.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Behavioral psychotherapy is best known for focusing on symptoms
as its main target, rather than viewing symptoms as signs of
underlying problems.  Like most generalities, this one has its
exceptions; some behavioral psychotherapists are very much
concerned with understanding the underlying causes of an
individual's difficulties.  Nevertheless, behavioral therapies do
tend to aim for concrete, specific, and prompt relief of
symptoms.  They frequently are effective, and they are based on
techniques that have been tested extensively.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE THREE SCHOOLS
</p>

<p>
Today there are three main schools of behavioral
psychotherapy:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
COUNTER-CONDITIONING
</p>

<p>
Also called <i>reciprocal inhibition</i>, this approach was developed
by Joseph Wolpe (1915-1997), a Jewish psychiatrist trained in
South Africa.  Anxiety is offset by means of desensitization,
assertiveness training, and sex therapy.  As the basis for desensitization,
deep relaxation is used to inhibit anxiety.  Assertiveness
training is used to counteract anxiety due to excessive shyness
or aggressiveness by helping individuals form balanced habits of
assertiveness that are neither submissive nor hostile.  Sex therapy
makes use of techniques of relaxation and desensitization to
permit clients to feel sexual arousal and, in this way, to
overcome sexual anxiety.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION
</p>

<p>
This approach was derived from the work of American
behaviorist B. F. Skinner (1904-1990) and others, who attempted to
show that a great many emotional problems result from situations in
which a person has been punished.  He or she comes to fear these
situations and develops emotional symptoms in an effort to
escape from them.  In behavior modification, attempts are made
to change behavior through the use of rewards or punishments.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
COGNITIVE APPROACHES TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE
</p>

<p>
These approaches make use of techniques developed outside
of behavioral psychotherapy, especially those of Albert Ellis's
rational-emotive therapy (see Chapter 10).  These cognitive
approaches are based on the belief that a person can gain control
over undesirable behavior and psychosomatic problems by
learning new habits of thinking.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These three schools of behavioral psychotherapy claim that
the problems leading people to enter therapy are <i>learned</i> and
can be unlearned through systematic training.  In particular,
anxiety&mdash;the primary source of emotional discomfort&mdash;can
become a learned habit.  When this happens, anxiety is linked to
stimuli that in themselves are usually harmless.  A person may
come to feel extremely anxious, for example, when in the
presence of people in authority, when in bed with a sex partner,
when near dogs or insects, when criticized by others, when in a
confined space, or in any number of other situations.  Anxiety in
these situations is learned, and it gradually becomes an
involuntary habit.  But the habit frequently can be broken and
eliminated.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHAT BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOTHERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p class="t3">
COUNTER-CONDITIONING
</p>

<p>
When you are exposed to a situation that you believe is
threatening, your blood pressure and pulse rate go up, your
muscle tension increases, the blood supply to your large muscle
groups increases, circulation to your stomach and genitals is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
reduced, your pupils may dilate, your mouth may get dry.  A
startling noise or a physical shock can produce these symptoms.
They are the physical manifestations of anxiety, and they are the
focus of counter-conditioning techniques.
</p>

<p>
Anxiety <i>generalizes</i> very easily.  If you were repeatedly
punished for playing with dirt as a child, dirt can evoke strong
anxiety in you as an adult.  If you were bitten by a dog, the sight
of a dog years later may make you feel anxious.  Anxiety can come
to be associated with almost any experience.  What is particularly
destructive about this is that you soon find yourself caught
in a vicious circle: a certain situation makes you anxious, you try
to avoid the situation and the anxiety it produces in you, and as
you do this, you build up <i>secondary</i> anxiety&mdash;you get anxious
that you'll get anxious.  So anxiety compounds, feeding on itself,
fueling itself.
</p>

<p>
Counter-conditioning therapists have found that, to varying
degrees, we are all capable of inhibiting anxiety.  A behavior
therapist tries to teach you how to do this, eventually so that you
can use relaxation techniques on your own.
</p>

<p>
The following are the main phases of desensitization
therapy&mdash;assertiveness training and sex therapy are similar, gradual, and
reassuring processes:
</p>

<p class="point">
1. You are taught how to achieve a state of relatively complete
physical relaxation.  Many therapists will tape relaxation
instructions so that you can practice daily at home for
twenty to thirty minutes.  Some therapists will instruct you
to <i>tense</i> your arms, hold the tension for ten seconds or so,
then relax and feel the resulting sense of relaxation, the
sense of relief from tension and strain.  Or, some therapists
use <i>suggestion</i>, asking you to imagine that your arms are
becoming heavier and heavier, encouraging you to relax
deeply.  Each of your major muscle groups is relaxed in turn
until you feel fully relaxed.  This first phase of therapy
usually takes from two to six sessions.
</p>

<p class="point">
2. Next a hierarchy is constructed by the therapist for each
individual client, ranking situations or stimuli from most to
least anxiety-producing.  A person who fears to leave the
sense of security of home already is aware of such a
hierarchy: low anxiety may be felt on the front steps,
greater anxiety when going out to the mailbox, more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
anxiety in walking around the block, and extreme anxiety
when facing a trip or a move to another residence.
</p>

<p class="point">
3. The last phase is the actual process of desensitization.  You
are asked to relax deeply with eyes closed, usually in a
recliner in the therapist's office.  You are asked to imagine a
scene taken from the low-anxiety end of your hierarchy.
The therapist tries to describe the scene as realistically and
vividly as possible.  If you begin to feel anxious, you can
raise an index finger, and then the therapist will shift away
from the imagined scene and will turn back to relaxation
instructions.  When you are again relaxed, the process
continues until, in time, you are able to imagine a scene
high on the hierarchy, but still sustain deep relaxation.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Once this process of desensitization can be accomplished in
the office, you begin anew, but now with actual situations&mdash;first
with those low on your hierarchy and then working your way
toward situations that used to cause you high anxiety.
Frequently, behavior therapists will accompany their clients outside
the office, helping them to remain relaxed&mdash;e.g., while riding
elevators, in crowds, even sometimes on airline flights if fear of
flying is the problem.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION
</p>

<p>
The central idea behind behavior modification is that undesirable
habits of behavior will gradually be eliminated if, consistently,
they are not rewarded or even are punished.  Conversely,
desirable habits are encouraged when they consistently are
reinforced or rewarded.
</p>

<p>
Therapists who use behavior modification techniques may
recommend both punishments and rewards to clients.  If you are
a chronic smoker or overeater, for example, you may be given a
small device with which to shock yourself moderately each time
you reach for a cigarette or a second helping.  Or, you may be
asked to deposit $100 with the therapist, and a certain amount
will be donated to your most disliked political group each time
you go astray.
</p>

<p>
Rewards, on the other hand, include material rewards that
clients may promise themselves once a habit is successfully
under control for a certain length of time.  Most therapists
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
encourage you eventually to substitute inner satisfactions: pride
in your slim appearance or improved health, strengthened
self-confidence, growth of sexual satisfaction, and, most importantly,
a developing sense of self-respect as you learn to gain control
over anxiety, frustration, or dissatisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Behavior therapists also use <i>distraction</i> techniques.  They
encourage you to do things that are incompatible with the
problem you wish to resolve.  Bicycling or lovemaking may prove
to be good antidotes for some individuals who overeat.  Hiking or
jogging, or physical reassurance, massage, or relaxing baths may
lessen anxiety.  Laughter releases tensions and offers its own
special kind of encouragement and healthier perspective.
</p>

<p>
Behavior modification requires strong initiative and discipline
on the part of the client.  More than these, it requires that you be
willing to let go of old habits that have been unsatisfying or
destructive and work to form new, more rewarding habits.  In the
beginning, forcing yourself to behave in new ways may feel like
pretense or dishonesty.  This is a common experience and should
not be allowed to block your desire to change.  Unfamiliar and
even uncomfortable ways of behaving do become familiar and
more comfortable the more they are practiced.  If these new ways
of behaving come to offer satisfactions or compensations that old
habits did not, they will gradually be absorbed into your own
sense of personal identity.  What at first may feel to you like an
act slowly is made a part of your personality until a habit is
established that feels entirely natural.  This takes time, patience,
practice, and more practice.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
COGNITIVE APPROACHES TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE
</p>

<p>
Behavioral psychotherapists use a variety of techniques
designed to help clients control their own behavior and individual
physical responses more effectively.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Biofeedback</i>
</p>

<p>
Biofeedback can help many people gain control over habitual,
automatic processes.  Biofeedback equipment can be used to
teach you how to reduce tension, develop skills to bring about
relaxation, or cope more successfully with chronic pain.  (For a
detailed discussion of biofeedback, see Chapter 15.)

<p>
Thought stopping can help you break chains of negative and
self-undermining thoughts.  Thought stopping is a technique that
begins by having you think out loud during therapy sessions.  If
you repeatedly express negative, troubling thoughts, the therapist
shouts, "Stop!"  In this way, you are made acutely aware of
self-destructive thinking habits.  You gradually learn to stop
yourself from trapping yourself in upsetting thoughts by silently
commanding your mind to "stop!"  It is a simple but often
effective technique, related to two techniques we have already
discussed: the push-button technique of Adlerian psychotherapy
(see Chapter 11) and the technique of disputing your own
irrational beliefs in rational-emotive therapy (see Chapter 10).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Problem Solving and Decision Making</i>
</p>

<p>
These techniques have been developed to help clients solve
personal problems and make life decisions more effectively.
Behavioral therapists who offer assistance of this kind emphasize
the importance in problem solving and decision making of
several factors.
</p>

<p>
One is refraining from implementing solutions or decisions
until you have clearly defined and understood your problem or
situation.  Another is becoming aware of emotional blocks to
solving problems and making decisions.  For example, procrastinating
serves to protect people from facing risks.  Individuals are
frequently also deterred from solving practical problems
because they are emotionally distracted by other difficulties that
demand attention first.  And people are inclined to jump at one
possible solution that then acts as a blinder to seeing other
potentially more promising alternatives.
</p>

<p>
Behavioral therapists also believe you must realize that, often,
difficulties you experience when trying to solve problems or
make decisions are due to conflicts between incompatible goals
or values.  Sometimes one objective cannot be achieved without
compromising another.  They also believe you must develop
abilities to imagine a wider range of alternatives.  And finally, they
believe you must become better able both to foresee likely
personal consequences of implementing a particular solution or
decision and to evaluate these in relation to what is personally
most important.

<p class="t3b">
AN EXAMPLE OF BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
Anne Holt was thirty-two when she came to see Dr. Cantwell.
She was noticeably anxious, wringing her hands, tense, and easily
startled, as when a car's exhaust backfired in the street below.
She complained of feeling unloved by her husband and was
always in dread of his criticisms.  She also felt her mother-in-law
was very critical of her.  Anne wanted to get away from the house
but had quit two jobs in succession, in each instance when her
boss's criticism of her work upset her.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Cantwell explained the rationale behind desensitization to
her and taught Anne how to practice systematic muscle relaxation,
beginning by tensing her hands, then relaxing them, tensing
them, then relaxing them again, and doing this with her arms,
shoulders, calf muscles, thighs, abdomen, jaw, neck muscles,
cheek, and mouth muscles.  He recorded his instructions on a
tape for her to use at home.
</p>

<p>
After five weeks of daily practice, Anne was usually able to
relax deeply in less than a minute.  Dr. Cantwell, in the meantime,
had gained a clearer idea of what troubled Anne, and he had
made up the following hierarchy:
</p>

<pre>
                      <i>Criticism directed at Anne from:</i>

  High anxiety                   Her husband
        |                        His mother
        |                        A boss
        |                        Anne's mother
  Low anxiety                    Anne's neighbor
</pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dr. Cantwell decided to use a combination of desensitization
and assertiveness training with Anne.  During half of each weekly
session with Dr. Cantwell, Anne was asked to relax in a recliner
with her eyes closed, and Dr. Cantwell would then describe
situations low on her hierarchy.  Anne was to try to maintain her
sense of relaxation <i>in spite of</i> Dr. Cantwell's description of an
imagined situation involving Anne's neighbor.  She was to
imagine that her neighbor, who was very fastidious about her own
yard, knocked at Anne's door to complain about Anne's habit of
setting the trash out the night before pickup.  Gradually, in a
similarly concrete way, Dr. Cantwell had Anne imagine her
mother criticizing Anne for using the same sponge for wiping up
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
in the kitchen as for washing the dishes; a boss asking Anne to
retype a business letter using another format that he preferred;
Anne's mother-in-law "dropping the hint" that her son liked to
have his T-shirts ironed; Anne's husband complaining because
Anne always overcooked the soft-boiled eggs.
</p>

<p>
During the second half of each session with Anne, Dr. Cantwell
played roles with Anne in which he taught her how to assert
herself more in situations involving criticism.  In one session, for
example, he took the part of Anne's mother and chose a typical
remark she might make: "Annie, dear, don't you think it would
be smarter to use a different sponge for wiping the kitchen
counter?  You should use a separate one for the dishes."  Dr. Cantwell
then asked Anne to think of a way she could reply to
her mother's "nice" criticism, without feeling bad about herself,
without "getting hooked."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
ANNE: Well, one way you've taught me would be to use humor: I
could say to her, "Mom, anytime you'd like to come
over to do the dishes, it would be fine with me."  And
then laugh.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. C.: That's a good approach.  But you don't want to be
offensive; you don't want to laugh <i>mockingly</i>.  <i>How</i> you
do this is important.  You want to set a good-natured
feeling.  Humor can be very useful to offset the sting of
criticism.  Can you think of a different way to reply to
your mother, in addition to humor?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
ANNE: Well, let's see....  Yes, well, I could go with her
suggestion and not interpret what she says to me as
criticism at all.  I could say, "Mom, thanks for the idea.
Maybe I'll do that."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. C.: Sounds very good.  That's another way.  The more
alternatives you can prepare yourself with ahead of
time, the less likely she will hook you, leaving you with
nothing to say and simply feeling bad.  Would you try to
think of one more alternative?  What other tack could
you take?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
ANNE: (After a moment of silence.)  I can't think of another.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. C.: How about telling your mother how you actually feel
when she criticizes you?  How <i>do</i> you feel?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
ANNE: Well, I wish she'd say some positive things instead, at
least sometimes.  That would be nice.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. C.: Great.  How could you tell her that?
</p>

<p class="quote2">
ANNE: Well, I could say, "Mom, you know, you give me a lot of
suggestions.  Some are OK, now and then, but, to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
honest, I'd really like to hear some praise sometimes.
Do you think you could find some things to
compliment me on?  I don't want any false praise, but I
need to hear some encouraging things from people I
love."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
DR. C.: Anne, you're doing very well: ... Humor, reinterpreting
so you don't feel criticized, and talking about criticism
from a more detached point of view.  You're definitely
learning how to cope with criticism much better.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
APPLICATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
Desensitization is normally used in the context of individual
therapy.  Behavior modification and cognitive approaches to
behavior change are frequently used in groups.  People with
problems in common&mdash;smoking, obesity, phobias, etc.&mdash;are
sometimes grouped together.  Often, however, a mixture in
groups is desirable.  For example, it is frequently helpful for shy
people to be part of a group in which they may watch others who
can model more assertive ways of acting.  (For more about group
therapy, see Chapter 13.)
</p>

<p>
Behavioral approaches to therapy must be tailored to the
individuality of each client; whatever goals are established have
to be in accord with the client's own desires.  Behavioral
psychotherapy presupposes that clients will practice instructions and
new behaviors between sessions and that they can maintain an
adequate level of motivation, both while in treatment and after
treatment ends, so that new habits of behaving or thinking can
become effective and reliable parts of their own personalities.
</p>

<p>
In general, behavioral approaches to therapy have been less
effective in treating panic attacks, chronic depression, substance
abuse (smoking, for example, is one of the habits most resistant
to formal therapy), and psychosis.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
COUNTER-CONDITIONING
</p>

<p>
This approach, which includes desensitization, assertiveness
training, and sex therapy, has been used effectively in treating
these problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* phobias
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* psychosomatic complaints
</p>

<p class="bullet">
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* sex, marriage, and family problems
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* passivity and shyness
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* personality trait problems: lonely, anxious, hostile, or
overbearing individuals
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION
</p>

<p>
This approach has been used successfully in connection with
these problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* sexually deviant behavior
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* children's problems, school discipline, academic
performance, and juvenile delinquency
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems of the mentally retarded and of psychotically
regressed individuals
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* some instances of obesity, alcoholism, and smoking
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* schizophrenia
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* stuttering
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
COGNITIVE APPROACHES TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE
</p>

<p>
These approaches have, for example, been used to treat such
problems as:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* anxiety and depression
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* adjustment problems
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* marital and sexual difficulties
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* psychosomatic problems
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The popular conception of behavioral therapists is that they
tend to be coldly scientific and mechanical.  Yet a number of
studies show that they are inclined to be warm individuals who
show positive regard for their clients.  In general they tend to be
empathetic and self-congruent.  These qualities are very much
needed if we as clients are to feel encouraged to face one of
the most difficult challenges life can pose for us: to change
ourselves.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span></p>

<p class="t2b">

<br />
GROUP THERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>Especially well-suited to people who are<br />
  outer-directed but lonely, who want to<br />
  develop their interpersonal skills,<br />
  and who would like to learn about<br />
  themselves from the perceptions of others.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Group therapy is ancient.  For as long as men have gathered
together to share their experiences, thoughts, and feelings and
to give one another comfort, group therapy has existed.  As an
approach to modern psychotherapy, however, it was in its
infancy fifty years ago.  No single great mind stands behind group
therapy; it has been and continues to be innovative, flexible, and
free from ties to any particular orthodox school of thought.
</p>

<p>
Clients who are attracted to group therapy and who often
benefit from group experience tend to have these characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are passive in their interactions with others.  They are
more comfortable being told what to do than facing the
need to decide for themselves.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are often lonely or socially isolated.  Individual
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
therapy, with its one-to-one relationship between therapist
and client, does not encourage some clients enough for
them to feel like members of humanity.  They tend to feel
sorry for themselves while in individual therapy or to
judge themselves harshly for their need for help.  Being
with other clients in a group situation answers their needs
better.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are outer-directed people: what others think of them
is crucial to how they think about themselves.  Inner-directed
individuals are likely to feel more interested in
and comfortable with individual therapy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For people who are relatively passive, lonely, yet
outer-directed, group therapy has some distinct advantages:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* It gives them a place within a group of people&mdash;they are
no longer alone.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* It gives them opportunities to express themselves freely,
confront other people, and say things that they otherwise
might not be able to express, thanks to the close and
confidential environment of the group.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They can hear how a variety of other people perceive
them.  They are not limited to the observations, ideas, and
recommendations of a single therapist.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They often feel more at ease in a group.  They feel less fear
or intimidation in the presence of the authority figure the
therapist represents.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They may benefit from the experiences of other group
members who have similar problems or who have very
different kinds of difficulties.  Knowing that they are not
troubled minorities of one can be a comfort; knowing that
other people have problems in areas where they don't can
be reassuring.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In general, group therapy can give you insight provided by the
thoughts and perceptions of others; it can help you develop
social ties if you feel isolated; and it can offer group support if
you need emotional bolstering in order to cope with difficult
situations, undertake decisions that may frighten you, and face
more calmly and confidently the many challenges life can present.
But it can also help you deal with more specific problems,
such as facing an especially stressful situation&mdash;the death of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
someone very close to you, divorce or separation, serious illness,
unemployment, drug addiction, or alcoholism.  Or perhaps you
have problems relating to others, such as having a history of
being fired from job after job despite your efforts to hold them.
For that matter, group therapy can even offer information about
job opportunities, how to develop occupational skills, how to
apply for a job, and how to keep a position you hold.
</p>

<p>
Some psychologists have commented that the popularity and
the need for the kind of experience that group therapy offers are
due to the decline of community life and to the virtual
disappearance of extended families living physically and emotionally
close to one another.
</p>

<p>
Group therapy is offered in private practice, in hospitals, and
in halfway houses; in psychiatric and counseling centers, in
clinics and hospital wards for patients with diabetes, AIDS,
epilepsy, arthritis, heart conditions, paralysis, blindness; in
prisons and juvenile detention centers; and in schools, for students
with behavior problems and truancy.  Group therapy is often
used for marriage, family, and child-guidance counseling and to
help families in which a member is physically or emotionally
disabled.  Group therapy is used by churches for family guidance
and for spiritual counseling.  It is used in virtually any area where
people share problems: victims of crime and physical abuse,
former patients, the aged, children of the aged, those who are
discriminated against&mdash;the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
So, group therapy cuts across virtually the whole range of
human problems.  Because it is used in so many areas, it is
impossible to define it as a single approach&mdash;many distinct
approaches actually may be involved.
</p>

<p>
Many of the approaches to psychotherapy we have already
looked at are used in groups.  There are psychoanalytically
oriented groups, Adlerian groups, Gestalt groups, groups that
use behavior modification, and others.  Perhaps the most useful
way to understand group therapy is to liken it to education.  Many
sorts of things can be taught, and many can be learned.  Group
therapy may be understood most clearly in relation to what
kinds of learning and teaching really go on in it.
</p>

<p>
Since group approaches to problem solving include many
applications beyond our scope here&mdash;in industry, religion,
schools, etc.&mdash;we will look more closely at the following forms of group
therapy that are used in the context of psychotherapy: brief group psychotherapy, T-groups,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
human potential groups, self-help groups, and the use of
specialized approaches to psychotherapy in a group setting.
(Marriage and family therapy, which are special forms of group therapy, are
of interest to a large number of people, so they are discussed
separately, in Chapter 14.)
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
BRIEF GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
Also known as <i>short-term encounter groups</i>, brief group
psychotherapy is intended for people who face life crises, who
are motivated to change, and who are comparatively free of
individual emotional disorders.  Normally, there are about ten
sessions.  People who find short-term group therapy useful
generally have well-defined problems to solve.  Their experience
in group therapy encourages them to become involved in new
activities, join clubs, perhaps do volunteer work after being
recently widowed, divorced, or separated; to take specific steps
to find employment; or to practice new ways of behaving&mdash;to
become more assertive, to implement a weight-loss plan, to
return to school after raising a family, or to change careers.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
T-GROUPS
</p>

<p>
Training groups were an outgrowth of the National Training
Laboratories, an organization formed in 1947 by social
psychologists who were interested in improving education.  T-groups
were made up of "normally adjusted people" who were interested
in improving their communication skills so they could
become more competent in difficult interpersonal situations.
</p>

<p>
T-groups gradually widened their focus and became the basis
for the practical orientation of many therapy groups today.
Clients who feel isolated or alienated, find it hard to relate to
others, lack a sense of meaning and direction, and do not have
strong self-discipline often are attracted to T-groups.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
HUMAN POTENTIAL GROUPS
</p>

<p>
These groups have probably done the most to give group
therapy its popular image.  "Growth centers" are usually rural
retreats where psychological growth of participants is encouraged.
Visits last from a weekend to several weeks.  The first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
center was called Lifewynn, organized in the 1920s at a summer
camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains.  The best-known
growth center is the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California,
formed in 1962 by Michael Murphy.  Its program combines
Gestalt therapy with Eastern meditation (see Chapter 15).  Other
similar growth centers have sprung up across the country.  In
addition to these, the est (Erhard Seminars Training) organization
has attracted a good deal of public attention and controversy.
The est approach is eclectic, combining Eastern thought,
Gestalt therapy, transactional analysis, psychoanalysis, Jungian
philosophy, positive thinking, meditation, and other approaches.
Some est leaders have been described as charismatic, proselytizing
personalities who claim to be able to lead participants to
salvation.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
SELF-HELP GROUPS
</p>

<p>
There are self-help groups to aid you with many different
kinds of problems.  They provide group moral support for
members with shared problems.  They are not intended to bring
about deep-seated personality change.  Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA), founded in 1934, probably is the most well-known self-help
organization.  Recovery, Inc., also known as the Association
of Nervous and Former Mental Patients, was formed in 1936 by
psychiatrist Abraham A. Low.  Meetings focus on members'
conscious control of symptoms; Recovery, Inc., frequently
encourages members to become involved in volunteer social work.
</p>

<p>
There are many other self-help organizations&mdash;for the
handicapped, widows, battered wives, diabetics, victims of AIDS,
hemophiliacs, homosexuals, drug addicts, and others.  (For
further information see "Appendix A: Agencies and Organizations
That Can Help.")
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
PSYCHOTHERAPY IN A GROUP SETTING
</p>

<p>
Most of the approaches to psychotherapy that we have
discussed provide treatment in the form of group therapy in
addition to individual therapy.  Group therapy is frequently
offered, for example, by psychoanalysts, client-centered therapists,
Gestalt therapists, transactional analysts, rational-emotive
therapists and general cognitive therapists, existential-humanistic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
therapists, reality therapists, Adlerian psychotherapists,
emotional flooding therapists, and behavior modification therapists.
In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss how group
therapy is handled by the main psychotherapies.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHAT GROUP THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Although your experience with group therapy will vary
depending on which school of therapy you have chosen, you will
find some common elements regardless of the approach.
</p>

<p>
Initially, there is likely to be a period of group confusion,
awkward periods of silence, some polite superficial conversation,
and often a frustrating lack of overall organization and
continuity.  Different group members will speak up, and what
they say may have absolutely nothing to do with what the
previous speaker has said; people are waiting for the chance to
talk about themselves and tend to concentrate so much on what
they are preparing to say that they don't pay attention to what
others have been saying.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, a more organized style of interacting comes into
being through the directive efforts of the therapist or as a result
of general group frustration over the lack of coherence.  At the
same time, group members will begin to feel more at ease with
one another and will in time begin to lift their public masks and
reveal more of their private selves&mdash;their often hard-to-admit
feelings of loneliness, pain, anxiety, depression, etc.&mdash;and to
express their personal needs.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, the first steps in the direction of expressing
private feelings will involve attacks on the therapist for not
structuring the group's interactions more or attacks on one
member for monopolizing group sessions.  Experienced group
therapists realize that these common negative attacks are
understandable tests of the trustworthiness and the safety of the group
as a place to express personal feelings.  If an atmosphere of
acceptance is established, and these initial complaints are
allowed to occur without catastrophe, some group members will
usually then begin to open up, to reveal some deeper feelings.
One member may begin to talk about her unhappy marriage, a
man about his gambling obsession, another about his loneliness
since his wife died.
</p>

<p>
At about this time it is common for group members to begin to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
tell one another how they feel about each other, how they see
one another.  Some of these comments will be positive, some
negative.  Here are some examples:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
"You have a really nice smile."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
"You remind me of my father, all these <i>shoulds</i>, <i>oughts</i>,
and rules!"
</p>

<p class="quote2">
"You never say much, so I feel you're just sitting there
judging us."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
"You make me nervous, biting your nails all the time."
</p>

<p class="quote2">
"Every time you say something, you put yourself or
somebody else down."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As this process continues, one or two group members will
begin to take an interest in the personal problems of some of the
others and express a desire to help.  They will ask questions for
more information, express sympathy or empathy, and begin to
offer suggestions.  It is at this point that the process of group
interaction begins to acquire a focus on healing and problem
solving.  Frequently, these expressions of desire to help one
member will encourage him or her for the first time to begin to
accept the kind of person he or she has been, to realize that "I
<i>have</i> been too hard on myself because I'm so damned perfectionistic,"
"I <i>am</i> a controller; I want other people to do things <i>my</i>
way," or "I live in a suit of armor; I'm just afraid of other people."
</p>

<p>
As members of the group come to know one another as real
personalities, they tend to become impatient whenever anyone
tries to put on his public mask again.  The group demands and
expects members to be honest about themselves.  Feelings can
run hot whenever Fred tries to make Alice accept his suggestions
because he <i>knows</i> what she really needs.  Group members can
show quick impatience with Judy whenever she tries to persuade
herself, even though her husband has severely beaten her several
times, that her marriage is <i>really</i> OK.
</p>

<p>
Group members quickly gain a good deal of information about
how others see them and feel about them.  As a result of an
implicit commitment to honesty, some members' ways of
behaving gradually change: a rough tone of voice becomes less
abrasive and calmer; offensive gestures and judging looks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
disappear; self-centeredness gives way to a certain amount of
sympathy and interest in other people.
</p>

<p>
Some of the values of group therapy are sensitively expressed
in this passage from a letter written by a client to his group:
</p>

<p class="quote2">
"I have come to the conclusion that my experiences with you
have profoundly affected me.  I am truly grateful.  This is
different from personal therapy.  None of you <i>had</i> to care about
me.  None of you had to seek me out and let me know of things
you thought would help me.  Yet you did, and as a result it has
far more meaning than anything I have so far experienced.
When I feel the need to hold back and not live spontaneously
for whatever reasons, I remember that twelve persons ... said
to let go and ... be myself and of all the unbelievable things
they even loved me....  This has given me the <i>courage</i> to come
out of myself many times since then...."[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap13fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap13fn1text">1</a>] Quoted in Carl R. Rogers, <i>Carl Rogers on Encounter Groups</i>
(New York: Harper and Row, 1970), p. 33.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE RISKS
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, like many healing processes, group therapy is
not for everyone.  There are recognized <i>risks</i> of entering group
therapy.
</p>

<p>
When members leave the intimacy of their group and return to
the "real world," they may feel disappointed and discouraged.
Their experience has given them the opportunity to dispense
with social masks, to become more authentic, to see the lies and
pretenses of others more clearly.  But the vast majority of people
outside the group have not learned these things and <i>do</i> live
behind masks they are not even conscious of.  When you gain
from a learning experience a perspective you can share with
comparatively few people, you're likely to feel discontented and
alienated.
</p>

<p>
You should also be aware that some of the changes that occur
in group therapy simply may not last very long after the group
stops meeting because the emotional and moral support offered
by the group are no longer there.  Or, group therapy may make
you aware for the first time of personal problems you had
ignored or evaded, leaving you hanging when the group
terminates.  So group therapy may bring about a need to solve
problems that, before the group experience, you didn't even
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
know you had.  These problems may then motivate you to enter
individual therapy.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you enter group therapy but your spouse does not,
your experience could bring marital tensions into the open,
leaving your spouse at a disadvantage.  Your spouse, who is
unfamiliar with what transpired during your group sessions, may
react defensively and without empathy to your desire to talk
about your feelings.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
GROUP TECHNIQUES
</p>

<p>
The techniques discussed below are commonly used in group
therapy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Content Analysis</i>
</p>

<p>
A member of the group describes a problem he or she is
having, and the therapist and other members make problem-solving
suggestions.  Their focus may be on why the person does
not want to solve the problem or on how the person brought the
problem on and maintains it.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Group Process</i>
</p>

<p>
After a series of interactions, comments, suggestions and
personal observations by group members, the therapist will ask
the group to stand back and look at the pattern of their
communication.  The group may become aware of the way one
member is consistently overlooked and is not given a fair share of
attention because of shyness or because another more forceful
member dominates the group's attention.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Models</i>
</p>

<p>
One member can work on personal problems in group therapy
by noting how another member goes about handling a similar
problem and then trying to learn from that example.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Analysis of Nonverbals</i>
</p>

<p>
The group therapist and members of the group can often help
make an individual better aware of how his or her behavior has
contributed to personal problems.  For example, Jim tends to be
shy, makes poor eye contact with people, has bad posture, and
speaks indistinctly because he has a habit of covering his mouth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
with his fingers.  The impression he makes on people is weak.  By
helping him pay attention to these nonverbal habits, group
members can encourage Jim to change so he will be more
successful, for example, at job interviews and generally feel
more confident.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
APPLICATIONS OF GROUP THERAPY
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, group therapy is most helpful to people with
these characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are lonely, socially isolated, or passive.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Their sense of worth depends greatly on what others think
of them.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They would like to improve their interpersonal skills.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They may be drawn to group therapy for the practical
reason that it tends to be less expensive than individual
therapy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Group therapy has the distinct advantage of providing clients
with multiple points of view; they receive feedback from the
therapist as well as from other members of the group.
</p>

<p>
Group therapy is potentially useful for a very wide range of
problems.  This is evident from the fact that most approaches to
psychotherapy offer therapy in a group setting.  Group therapy is
generally <i>not</i> the treatment of choice for these individuals:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* persons lacking communication skills
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* those who lack the motivation to attend group sessions
regularly or who refuse to keep information about other
group members confidential outside of the group
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* people who are severely disturbed
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* individuals who are intellectually impaired
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* those suffering from chronic depression
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* psychopathic or sociopathic adolescents (who do not have
a sense of social conscience)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Group therapy, as we have noted, also appeals <i>less</i> to inner-directed
individuals and is therefore less likely to be helpful to
them.

MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY
<br /><br />
  <i>For couples and families with problems of<br />
  communication, strain, and conflict,<br />
  and for individuals whose difficulties<br />
  are best resolved with the participation<br />
  of other family members.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
The family is the basic source of health or sickness.
<br /><br />
Vincent D. Foley, <i>Current Psychotherapies</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
During the last forty years there has been a gradual shift away
from an emphasis on individual therapy to a belief that many
emotional difficulties people experience have their roots&mdash;and
often, also their solutions&mdash;in their marriages or families.  As this
shift in emphasis grew, many therapists saw that marriage and
family relationships make up units, or systems, each with a
personality of its own.  Members of a family gain their identities
from their roles in the family system.  This systems view made it
possible for therapists to understand families and marriages
more clearly as interdependent, interlocking, functioning
wholes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
</p>

<p>
Marriage and family therapy treats emotional disorders in
terms of the interdependent relationships among members.  The
marriage or family system is thought of as a unit with properties
that reach beyond the sum of the personal qualities of the
individuals who make it up.  Usually, one person in a family or
marriage is more troubled; his or her symptoms are more
pronounced.  The husband tends to feel his wife has "the
problem," or vice versa.  Mother and father feel that little Richard
is "the problem."  However, therapists believe that the problems
experienced and expressed by the "sick" person are really signs
that something is wrong with the whole system.  A "heart
problem" is frequently part of a larger problem, such as poor
diet or excessive stress, and the same is true for couples or
families.  One person's distress tells the therapist that, often,
something is troubling both husband and wife or all the
members of a family.
</p>

<p>
This interdependence between partners of a marriage or
members of a family system frequently leads to a complex
situation in which emotional difficulties are contagious, one
person's improvement is connected with another's getting
worse, or treating one person separately draws the members of
a relationship apart.
</p>

<p>
One of the very difficult problems troubled couples or families
face is that emotional disturbance can often "spread."  Repeatedly,
therapists observe that there is a kind of subtle transmission
from one generation to the next of inner conflicts and
difficulties in coping with life.  And beyond this, there are
intimate connections between the emotional makeup and
emotional balance of married partners or family members.  For
example, it is all too common for the partner of a chronically
depressed person also to fall into a serious depression.  Marriage
and family therapists are therefore inclined to see the emotional
disturbance of one member in terms of a troubled, ineffective
pattern of interaction.
</p>

<p>
Because of their close ties, sometimes one person's behavior,
attitudes, or feelings get better while another family member
develops new symptoms or problems.  We will look at a real
example of this in a moment.
</p>

<p>
Marriage and family therapists have noticed that, when one
person in a marriage or family is treated separately, the family
members frequently are drawn apart instead of brought closer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
together.  Therefore, therapists generally feel it is essential to see
husband and wife together or to involve both parents and
children in therapy.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of marriage or family therapy is not only to
resolve existing problems but also to help clients cultivate a new
way of communicating and interacting together.  Marriage
therapy and family therapy of course seek to relieve emotional
distress by helping to reduce or end conflicts and to lessen
anxiety, frustration, anger, or resentments.  But beyond these,
marriage and family therapists try to show clients how to
complement one another's personal needs.  They also attempt to
strengthen bonds between them so that they are able to face
crises and emotional upsets with greater strength, balance, and
courage.  And they try to redirect clients' values in a way that will
support the personal growth of each person.
</p>

<p>
How long marriage or family therapy will take depends primarily
on the goals of the couple or family. Here are some estimates:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to reduce tensions: perhaps six sessions
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to reduce symptoms such as emotional distress or
behavioral problems: ten to fifteen sessions
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to improve communication habits: twenty-five to thirty
sessions over six to eight months
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* to restructure relationships so that members of the family
system will have more independence and will cultivate an
awareness that they do have separate identities: forty
sessions or more
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  WHAT MARRIAGE AND<br />
  FAMILY THERAPIES ARE LIKE<br />
</p>

<p>
Marriage therapy and family therapy are distinct from group
therapy in two important ways.  First, unlike in group therapy the
clients in marriage or family therapy have a shared history and, if
therapy is successful, will often be able to enjoy a shared future.
Second, in marriage and family therapy, the therapist is more
active and directive than in group therapy.  Any changes made by
members of a group come about because of interactions among
the group members; a group therapist acts as a moderator or
facilitator, while the role of a marriage or family therapist
resembles that of a teacher.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
</p>

<p>
Marriage and family therapy focuses on <i>present</i> interactions
between husband and wife or among family members.  It is not
that the past is judged to be unimportant, but it is not generally
useful to pay a great deal of attention to what has already
happened.  What causes problems <i>now</i> are the current patterns
and habits of interaction in the family or marriage.  A wife may
have been drinking for fifteen years because her mother undermined
her sense of self-confidence, but the fact is that she no
longer lives with her mother.  However, she <i>did</i> choose to live
with a man who continued her mother's pattern of undermining
abuse.  A marriage therapist will focus on present difficulties and,
by doing this, may be able to help her resolve her drinking
problem by improving a troubled relationship with her husband.
</p>

<p>
Jay Haley (1923-2007), a leading marriage and family therapist,
has expressed the belief that concentrating on feelings and
thinking will not lead to change, that empathy on the part of the
therapist does not correct problems, and that insight often just
provides an excuse for intellectual rationalization and
game-playing.[<a id="chap14fn1text"></a><a href="#chap14fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap14fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap14fn1text">1</a>] Jay Haley, "Marriage Therapy," in Gerald D. Erickson
and Terrance P. Hogan,
eds., <i>Family Therapy: An Introduction to Theory and Technique</i>
(Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1972), pp. 180-210.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Because the patterns of behavior of a troubled couple or family
tend to be very rigid, therapists have found that strongly directive
techniques are most effective.  Their focus is on developing
interventions&mdash;or therapeutic strategies&mdash;that will have a real
impact on the complex patterns of interaction that have come to
paralyze a couple or a family.
</p>

<p>
What seems to help in marriage and family therapy is ingenuity
on the part of the therapist that will give him or her power or
control over a situation that is out of control.  One way to do this
is to force clients into a paradoxical situation.  For example, the
therapist may prescribe that a couple or members of a family
<i>continue</i> their present unsatisfying behavior.  As a result, they
may (and very likely will) rebel so that desired change comes
about.[<a id="chap14fn2text"></a><a href="#chap14fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap14fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap14fn2text">2</a>] As we have seen,
logotherapy and Adlerian therapy both make use of this
technique, as do family therapists, as we will see later on.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All family therapy <i>is</i> marriage therapy to a certain extent.  And
so, suppose we first look more closely at what marriage therapy
is like.

</p>

<p class="t3">
MARRIAGE THERAPY
</p>

<p>
Marriage therapy is generally advisable[<a id="chap14fn3text"></a><a href="#chap14fn3">3</a>] when the husband or
wife has sought help in individual counseling but this has not
been helpful.  Sometimes the marital relationship itself inhibits,
or even undermines, the improvement of the most troubled
person.  For example, individual therapy did nothing to help one
woman who was suffering from severe chronic anxiety.  When
her husband was asked to participate in treatment, it was found
that he abused his wife continuously but subtly.  Whenever she
spoke, he would criticize her views and indirectly slight her
worth; when he lost something, he would often accuse her of
misplacing it.  The problem she had come for help with turned
out to be marital rather than individual.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap14fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap14fn3text">3</a>] See Jay Haley, "<i>Marriage Therapy</i>," pp. 180-210.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If you are unable or unwilling to communicate openly and
adequately with a therapist, marriage therapy may encourage
your spouse to become more involved in the process of therapy.
Often, having the other marital partner present will stimulate an
otherwise silent client to express himself or herself, especially to
correct what the other partner has to say!
</p>

<p>
If you suddenly become severely troubled at the time of a
marital conflict, marriage therapy may be useful.  A spouse who
falls into a deep depression immediately after a quarrel may be
troubled in a way that marriage therapy can treat.
</p>

<p>
Finally, marriage therapy is of course essential if a husband and
wife are in conflict and serious distress and cannot resolve their
differences.  Frequently, one spouse (usually the wife) will want
marriage therapy; the other will come, but reluctantly.  However,
both often <i>will</i> come, because if one is in distress the other is
affected.
</p>

<p>
Conflicts in marriage frequently come about because of
disagreements having to do with the couple's rules for living
together, especially regarding how each is to treat the other.
Who sets the rules is often another area of conflict, as are
incompatible rules.  For example, a wife insists that her husband
stop being a "mama's boy" and demeans him for being
dominated by a woman; yet it is <i>she</i> who seeks to dominate her
husband by insisting that <i>he</i> be more domineering.
</p>

<p>
In marriage therapy (and also in family therapy), therapists
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
encounter a great deal of resistance to change on the part of
their clients.  (Alas, so do all other therapists!)  A main reason for
resistance is that, in a marital relationship or family system,
change in one member's feelings and behavior will tend to affect
another's, often in unsuspected ways.  Change disturbs the
established balance of their system, a balance that does serve some
purposes.
</p>

<p>
Jane Dowland, for example, went to see Dr. Carlton because of
her husband's depression.  Phil had lost his job and now spent
most of his time at home, feeling sorry for himself and collecting
unemployment benefits.  Jane was easily upset and felt terribly
insecure.  Dr. Carlton recommended that Phil accompany Jane to
the next session.  After seeing Phil, Dr. Carlton referred him to a
psychiatrist, who was able to treat Phil's depression effectively in
four months' time with medication.  Jane, however, continued
to feel severely (and perhaps even more) anxious, although
Phil's symptoms were now under control and he was back at work.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Carlton recommended marriage therapy to Jane and Phil.
They saw Dr. Carlton once a week for three months.  It became
clear to Dr. Carlton, and eventually clear to Jane, that without
realizing it she had used Phil's depression as an excuse for her
own anxiety so that she could evade responsibility for herself.
She came to realize that she had been unable to resolve her own
conflicting needs&mdash;whether to have children in spite of Phil's
disinterest in children or whether to commit herself to
developing a career.
</p>

<p>
Treating Phil's depression led Jane to become aware of her
own problems.  The balance in their relationship was changed by
therapy: Jane found out that Phil's depression was really a
problem that served a purpose for her&mdash;without it, she needed
help for herself.
</p>

<p>
Because of the complex, interwoven nature of a marital
relationship, it is often difficult to separate the problems each
partner may experience.  One partner's symptoms may mask the
other's problem.  Or, one person's problem may be perpetuated
by the other's behavior, interfering with the resolution of the
problem.  Further, each partner may encourage distress in the
other as a result of differing expectations concerning rules of
living together and who sets them.

<p class="t3">
FAMILY THERAPY
</p>

<p class="quote2">
In family therapy, the "identified patient" is seen as but a
symptom, and the system itself (the family) is viewed as the
client.
<br /><br />
Vincent D. Foley, <i>Current Psychotherapies</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
Very often, one family member is labeled the one with the
problem, the one who is "sick."  When the family decides to
enter therapy, it is usual for family members to feel troubled,
scared, and confused.  They realize that something is wrong, but
they are uncertain about what is amiss and don't know what to
do.  The usual response to this perplexity is to push the
"identified patient" forward&mdash;usually a child who is "the
problem"&mdash;and try to make him or her the focus of treatment.
</p>

<p>
As the members of the family are interviewed, individually and
together, the therapist is able to assemble a coherent picture of
the family, its typical ways of interacting, the habitual, automatic
patterns of response of one family member to another, the
family's values and beliefs.  What one member tries to hide
another often will express.
</p>

<p>
The family therapist has a difficult double role, as both
observer and participant.  He or she needs to be able to notice
what the styles of interaction of individual family members are
and <i>at the same time</i> interact with members of the family.  The
therapist tries to bring about meaningful emotional interchange,
create an atmosphere of trust and rapport, and reduce the
feeling that family members are threatened.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the therapist seeks to show the members of a family
how they tend to interrelate inappropriately, how their own
ineffective defenses cause them to hurt one another.  To do this,
the therapist has to be able to cut through the vicious circles of
resentment, anger, blame, frustration, and intimidation that
frequently hold families in a death grip.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE THERAPIST'S FUNCTIONS
</p>

<p>
In both marriage and family therapy therapists must:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* establish a sense of rapport and trusting communication
between clients and themselves
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* use this rapport to bring out the conflicts, frustrations,
and inadequate means of communication that burden their
clients
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* see through denials, rationalizations, and excuses
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* push family members to put out in the open feelings and
pains they have kept from one another
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* bring to a halt the family's tendency to focus on one
person as a scapegoat, "the problem"
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* act in understanding, calm, and emotionally supportive
ways and help supply the emotional stability that the
couple or family temporarily lacks
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* try to exemplify or personify for clients what it is to be
adult, mature, caring, and able to relate openly and
without feeling threatened
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY TECHNIQUES
</p>

<p>
Marriage and family therapists may use a variety of techniques
to encourage their clients to change in constructive ways.  For
example, it is becoming more common to <i>videotape sessions</i> so
that couples and families may become more aware of their
automatic, self-destructive patterns of interaction&mdash;which
makes it easier to change them.
</p>

<p>
Family therapists also sometimes make <i>home visits</i>: often,
being in their own familiar surroundings will encourage family
members to let down their defenses and more clearly define the
problems that need to be resolved.  Another innovation that is
becoming more widespread is <i>multifamily therapy</i>.  Two or
three families participate together in an especially modified
form of group therapy so that each family can see its own
problems in clearer perspective and learn by seeing more or less
troubled interactions among members of another family.
</p>

<p>
Techniques drawn from <i>behavior modification</i> are frequently
used in family therapy, especially when family difficulties seem
to be localized around the behavior of rebellious or delinquent
children.
</p>

<p>
<i>Paradoxical intention</i>, discussed in Chapter 11, can also be
very helpful in marriage and family therapy.  Instead of trying to
restore a state of balance between husband and wife or among
family members&mdash;something that usually stimulates the couple
or family to fight to hold on to its old habits&mdash;a therapist
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
encourages a state of imbalance so that the unbalanced system
falls of its own weight.  The cure, paradoxically, may lie in
intensifying the problem.  For example, a wife has migraines that
prevent her from doing her family chores.  A child throws up
when he is forced to go to school.  Both claim that they "just can't
help it."  The therapist's response might be, "I realize you can't
help it.  What I want you to do, Alice, when you feel household
chores are just too much, is to go to bed and permit yourself to
have a migraine.  Don't fight it.  Go ahead and have a bad
headache.  It gives you some relief, so I want you to do this
through your own choice.  And you, Johnny, I want you to go into
the bathroom before you leave for school and throw up.  It is
unpleasant, but it hasn't hurt you.  If you need to, stick your
finger down your throat.  I want you to take control and make
yourself throw up each morning before going to school.  And
you, Alice, you won't interfere or try to mother him; let him
alone.  But do remind him to go and throw up."  In a very short
time, the results of these paradoxical strategies can be
surprisingly effective.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  APPLICATIONS OF MARRIAGE AND<br />
  FAMILY THERAPY<br />
</p>

<p>
As in all approaches to therapy, the effectiveness of marriage
and family therapy depends on the strength of the clients' desire
to overcome the difficulties that have motivated them to ask for
help.  Goodwill and commitment to change may or may not be
there.  Sometimes a therapist can help clients become aware of
their deep-seated but habitually ignored feelings of warmth
toward one another.  At other times, marriage therapy may lead to
separation and divorce, if a couple comes to realize that their
goals really are not compatible and what each needs or wants
from the relationship the other is not able or willing to give.
Marriage therapy and family therapy are not magic wands that
can be waved over trouble to make things better.  Therapists can
make specific recommendations, they can help a couple or family
become explicitly aware of destructive patterns, they can point
to and illustrate constructive ways of interacting, and they can
sometimes use therapeutic strategies to break old habits and
make room for care and sensitivity to the needs of wife, husband,
and children.  These interventions from a therapist can be very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
helpful, perhaps even crucial, but they are, at most, <i>catalysts</i> for
change: real and lasting changes can only come from clients
themselves.  Marriage or family therapy is ideally an educational
experience.  What wife, husband, and children do with what they
have learned is, in the end, up to them.
</p>

<p>
Family therapy has been especially effective in dealing with
these problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems due to conflicts among family members
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* emotional disturbances in children
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* some cases of schizophrenia where members of the family
are frequently not well-individuated&mdash;each person's
identity is so bound up with the outlooks and behavior of
other family members that no one has a clear sense of his
or her own personal identity and separateness
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems that are interlocking, where the difficulties of
one member of the family cannot be resolved without the
cooperation of the others
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* problems experienced by a family when a child becomes
old enough to leave home
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Family therapy has been much <i>less</i> effective in treating
paranoia in one member of the family, and behavioral problems
stemming from sexual disorders.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Marriage therapy has been effective in helping couples with
any of these characteristics or problems:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They communicate and interact in ways that lead to
conflict, frustration, anger, and unhappiness.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are insufficiently sensitive to one another's needs.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have unstated and conflicting expectations
concerning their relationships.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They will work together to help one partner overcome
individual difficulties.

CHANNELING AWARENESS:
<br /><br />
  Exercise, Biofeedback,<br />
  Relaxation Training, Hypnosis,<br />
  and Meditation<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All of these approaches to therapy serve to <i>channel</i> awareness in
particular ways, to provide a point of focus for the mind.  They
are all processes that eliminate distractions and enable you to
direct your awareness in ways that are basically different from
normal, everyday waking consciousness.  Special kinds of
absorption or concentration characterize the therapeutic uses of
exercise, biofeedback, relaxation training, hypnosis, and meditation.

<p class="quote2">
It is my contention that, just as prayer, meditation, dream
analysis and some drug experiences open doors into these
areas not usually accessible to us, under the appropriate
circumstances slow long-distance running opens similar
doors.  The subjective experience of the runner appears the

aspects, particularly in connection with the kinds of symptoms
and problems that bring people to psychotherapy.

Much of the modest amount of research on the psychotherapeutic
value of exercise has focused on running, probably for
the following reasons:  First, slow long-distance running seems to be an
anatomically natural activity for us, with our species' two relatively
long legs.  Second, running appears to be an especially effective
way to derive specific therapeutic benefits from an aerobic
activity.  And, of course, running has recently become very
popular.
</p>

<p>
Most exercise physiologists claim that the physical, and very
likely also the psychological, effects of other aerobic forms of
exercise, such as bicycling, swimming, and cross-country skiing,
are essentially equivalent to running.  So, until we know
otherwise, we will assume that what is true of running is likely to be true of other
types of exercise that make similar demands on the body, and we
will focus here on running.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Kostrubala has attempted to describe a particular approach
to running that seems to have definite psychotherapeutic
value.  More is involved than donning a pair of running shoes and
starting out, as we will see.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Kostrubala has found that running is emotionally or
mentally therapeutic under certain conditions.  First, you need to
make sure that you are in <i>medically good condition</i> to begin a
therapeutic running program.  It would be prudent to have a
thorough physical and, if you are over forty, also a stress test.  You
need to do warm-up exercises, which any good book on running
describes in detail, and then you need to build up your
endurance&mdash;gradually and patiently&mdash;until you can run a <i>minimum</i> of
three times a week for an hour each time, without stopping, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
with a pulse rate of at least 75 percent of your maximum heart
rate.  (Your maximum heart rate is 220 beats per minute minus
your age.  If you are 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is 180.
Seventy-five percent of 180 yields a pulse rate of 135 beats per
minute.  If you are 40, you would want to run for an hour so as to
maintain a pulse rate of 135 beats per minute during your run.
By way of encouragement, you may want to know that 75 percent
of a person's maximum heart rate represents, for almost
everyone, a slow, easy jog.)  Second, you must have a <i>noncompetitive
attitude</i> toward running.  Whether you're comparing yourself to
others or just trying to beat your own running record, a
competitive drive rivets your attention on a goal separate from
yourself.  This misplaced emphasis will undermine the therapeutic
value of the activity.
</p>

<p>
You also should either run alone or with someone who won't
distract you by talking.  Direct your attention within&mdash;to the
rhythm of your pace, the regularity of your breathing, maintaining
relaxation in your shoulders, back, and feet.  To prevent
distraction it is also important to run in an area or around a track
that is familiar to you.  For slow long-distance running to have a
therapeutic effect, you cannot be a sightseer.  The novelty of
unfamiliar surroundings will distract you from being
inner-directed, which is therapeutically important.
</p>

<p>
Finally, be aware of the physical risks.  If you begin to feel dizzy,
stop running.  In hot weather, dizziness is a first warning sign of
heat exhaustion, which can lead to heatstroke.  If you feel a snap
in one of your running muscles, stop.  An internal snapping or
popping noise can mean that a muscle or tendon has torn, or a
small bone has broken.  Make sure you are all right before
resuming.  If you have a cramp-like pain in your side, which is very
common, try slowing down, exhaling forcefully, giving a yell, or
singing.  You can often keep going, and the pain will subside.  If it
does not, or it gets worse, you'll need to stop to rest.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT RUNNING AS THERAPY FEELS LIKE
</p>

<p>
The psychological effects of regular, slow long-distance
running can be impressive if you follow the directions above.
</p>

<p>
During the first twenty minutes, you may feel slow and stiff
and not very inspired about the run.  You may find yourself in a
sour mood.  (There is even a term for this phase: <i>dysphoria</i>.)
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
Persuade yourself that it is not important and keep going.
</p>

<p>
Between twenty and thirty minutes, if you are dysphoric, that
feeling may peak; some people even begin to cry.  This is not
necessarily depression; it may actually feel good.  (Another
reason to run alone: other people won't understand and may
want to "rescue" you from your therapeutic endeavor.)
</p>

<p>
At some point, after about thirty minutes of running, you will
probably find that your mind refuses to do any more problem
solving.  You stop worrying, problems you may have been dwelling
on simply begin to feel distasteful, and your mind clears.
(After a good run, when you do return to the problem, you may
well find that it is less difficult to think through.)
</p>

<p>
Between thirty and forty minutes, many people begin to feel
more "open"&mdash;their breathing begins to come more freely, and
their whole system seems to work more smoothly and with less
effort.  This can be a wonderful feeling.
</p>

<p>
After you have been running for forty minutes, the first
alterations in your consciousness may begin.  Your senses begin
to feel more alert, more alive.  Things seem more vivid&mdash;the
colors of leaves, the song of a bird, the freshness of the air.
Runners who have experienced this say that this natural, vivid,
fresh sense of perception is unique; to some extent it may
resemble the experience that comes from meditation, biofeedback,
or drugs.  This experience seems not to occur before forty
minutes of running.  It may be an experience of mild euphoria, or
you may feel it as a marked increase in aesthetic sensitivity or as
a sense of growing inner serenity.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF EXERCISE AS PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p class="quote2">
I'm sure that these experiences are closely related to
meditation.  The clearing of consciousness, the ability to find a
central focus within, the delight of a clear mind, the sense of
refreshment of the soul are reported both by those who
practice meditation and by long-distance runners.  The difference
between the two techniques is in the physical effects of
the running.  It is as if those who meditate have found one half
of the picture.  The runners who just compete and do not
reach for the psychological aspects have found the other half.
The runners who are able to slow down and search for the
psychic aspects will have both&mdash;the soul and the body.
<br /><br />
Thaddeus Kostrubala, <i>The Joy of Running</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
</p>

<p>
Even though aerobic exercise such as slow long-distance
running can produce a feeling of moderate depression during
the first thirty minutes, people who have moderate, lingering
depressions in daily life often find that, as described above,
depression disappears after about forty minutes.  Anger and
hostility also seem to be much reduced after about thirty
minutes of running.
</p>

<p>
The repetitive rhythm and sustained exertion of slow long-distance
running appear to tire the conscious mind.  Many
anxieties, tensions, worries, feelings of guilt, anger, and depression
lift.  The easily distracted, constantly nervous and shifting
focus of everyday consciousness gives way to a sense of integration,
of being one with yourself and the activity of running.

<p class="bullet">

</p>

<p class="bullet">

</p>

</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Treating Depression</i>
</p>

<p>
In particular, running as described here appears to be especially
effective in treating depression: "... it's hard to run and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
feel sorry for yourself at the same time."[<a id="chap15fn1text"></a><a href="#chap15fn1">1</a>]  Running tends to
increase your sense of independence and self-confidence, which
have been weakened if you have been depressed.  Psychotherapy
and drug therapy, in contrast, may encourage <i>dependency</i> on the
therapist or psychiatrist.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap15fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn1text">1</a>] James Fixx, <i>The Complete Book of Running</i>
(New York: Random House, 1977), p. 16.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dr. Kostrubala has noticed that long-distance running often
greatly reduces or even eliminates the typical early morning
awakening and insomnia of the chronically depressed person.
This particularly painful symptom involves jarring awake to a
new day to be faced&mdash;a day of anxiety, fears, and hopelessness to
be combated.  If you have experienced this, you are probably
familiar with waking up too early, at what the Swedes call "the
hour of the wolf," lying in bed, exhausting yourself with crushing
worries, despair, and tears, and beginning the day in a state
of emotional exhaustion.  Kostrubala has found that as depressed
people cultivate the habit of long-distance running, these early
morning ordeals often gradually subside and disappear.
</p>

<p>
A British medical group led by Dr. Malcolm Carruthers discovered
that individuals who exercise vigorously produce increased
levels of the hormone epinephrine, which counteracts depression.
Apparently, strong exercise for even ten minutes doubles
the normal level of epinephrine; the effects of the heightened
level of the hormone can be fairly long-lasting.
</p>

<p>
Another study, by psychiatrist John Greist at the University of
Wisconsin, revealed that one group of seriously depressed
patients benefited more from a ten-week session of therapeutic
running than another group benefited from traditional therapy.
</p>

<p>
To summarize research findings on exercise as a treatment for
depression:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* To be effective, vigorous exercise must be done regularly
no less than three times a week, and preferably at least five
times a week, for periods lasting between thirty minutes
and an hour.  (Dr. Kostrubala uses an hour as a
goal.)
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Although running and running combined with walking are
the most commonly used therapeutic forms of exercise,
any regular aerobic exercise is likely to produce the same
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
antidepressant effects when done for proportional periods
of exertion.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Studies over the past ten years show that lessening
depression by means of exercise is most successful for
persons with mild to moderate depression, but vigorous
exercise tends <i>not</i> to benefit patients with <i>severe</i>
depression.[<a id="chap15fn2text"></a><a href="#chap15fn2">2</a>]

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Lessening Anxiety</i>
</p>

<p>
Therapeutic running also tends appreciably to lessen anxiety.
A research study conducted by Dr. Herbert A. deVries of the
University of Southern California School of Medicine and Gene
M. Adams of USC's Gerontology Center found that fifteen
minutes of moderate exercise diminished anxiety more in people
aged fifty-two to seventy than did 400-milligram doses of
meprobamate, a widely prescribed tranquilizer.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>For Schizophrenics</i>
</p>

<p>
Therapeutic running also seems to benefit schizophrenic
patients.  Schizophrenia is a complex, difficult-to-treat illness
that affects approximately 1 percent of the world's population.  It
is no respecter of particular cultures.  There are many forms of
the illness, but all are characterized by disabling blockages to
normal human interrelation, strange behavior, loss of contact
with reality, and withdrawal, paranoia, or hallucinations.  Again,
Dr. Kostrubala has attempted to help patients with this condition
through a combined program of medication, psychotherapy,
and therapeutic running.  Although he is careful to emphasize
that controlled studies have yet to be made, his judgment about
the patients he has treated is that
</p>

<p class="quote">
... using this form of running therapy ... [I] have seen them
change dramatically.  They begin to lose their symptoms;
medication can be reduced and often discontinued; and they

<p class="t3">
<i>The Risks</i>
</p>

<p>
Since therapeutic running appears to be of psychiatric value, it
is not surprising that it, like any attempt to heal, may have
potential risks.  Aside from the obvious potential for sports-related
injuries, there is a specific risk: physical addiction.  Dr. William
Glasser, whose approach to psychotherapy we discussed
in the section dealing with reality therapy (Chapter 11), agrees
with Kostrubala that therapeutic running is addictive.  Glasser
calls it a <i>positive</i> addiction, since&mdash;unlike the use of alcohol,
barbiturates, and opiates&mdash;running is constructive and
therapeutic.[<a id="chap15fn5text"></a><a href="#chap15fn5">5</a>]  However, like alcoholism and drug addiction,
therapeutic running <i>does</i> produce very real withdrawal symptoms if a
dedicated runner cannot continue to run, whether temporarily
because of an injury or illness, or permanently.  Withdrawal
symptoms can be surprisingly severe: primarily, strong anxiety
and insomnia, but sometimes also restlessness, sweating, weight
gain or loss, and/or depression.

BIOFEEDBACK
<br /><br />
  <i>In psychotherapy, especially useful for clients<br />
  with problems involving anxiety, depression,<br />
  phobias, and insomnia, who will benefit from<br />
  learning how to lessen their own tension.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Most of us can draw a relatively clear line between the
physiological processes we can control and those we cannot.
Unless an illness or accident or handicap interferes, we have
voluntary control over many muscles, but there are many that,
fortunately, work without our conscious intercession: the heart
beats day and night, our lungs fill and empty, our digestive
processes are automatic.  Except for people who have voluntary
control over the muscles that move their ears, we are all more or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
less equally endowed, and equally limited, in what physical
processes we are able to influence.
</p>

<p>
Until the development of biofeedback, there was only one way
to extend self-control beyond the normal range: through a
disciplined and time-consuming practice such as yoga.  Experienced
practitioners of yoga claim that studying yoga over a period of
years has given them a sense of personal integration and mental
centering similar to what we will see in connection with the
practice of meditation.  Physical and emotional flexibility also
seem to result from long-term yoga practice.
</p>

<p>
Some yogis have extended their range of control over inner,
normally involuntary processes in dramatic ways.  Some can
cause their heart rate to increase to five times its resting rate.
Some are able to cause a ten-degree temperature difference
between the thumb and little finger of the same hand: one side is
flushed and hot, the other side cool and pale.  Many other forms
of self-control have been documented,[<a id="chap15fn6text"></a><a href="#chap15fn6">6</a>] but acquiring these
special skills through the practice of yoga takes years of
discipline, concentration, and tenacity.  But the years of dedication
seem also to be indispensable if one is to develop the qualities of
inner tranquility and strength sought by yogis.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap15fn6"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn6text">6</a>] See, e.g., Mircea Eliade, <i>Yoga:
Immortality and Freedom</i> (Princeton, NJ:
Princeton University Press, 1958).
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Biofeedback has greatly shortened the yogis' road to conscious
control of some physical processes, and, in turn, it has become
the main contribution technology has made so far to psychotherapy.
Many of the physical processes that biofeedback training can
help you learn rather quickly to control influence your
emotional well-being.  Biofeedback equipment can enable you to
learn, for example, how to <i>will</i> a state of muscular relaxation,
how to gain a measure of control over your physical response to
stress or pain, even how to raise or lower your blood pressure or
heart or respiration rate.
</p>

<p>
To use biofeedback equipment, electrodes are taped to the
areas of your body that are to be monitored.  They may measure
such things as skin temperature, skin moisture, muscle tension,
pulse and breathing rates, or brain wave patterns.  The feedback
from which you learn to control normally involuntary processes
occurs when the measurements made by the instruments are
externalized for you: you are able to <i>see</i> a pattern on a computer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
monitor or oscilloscope or <i>hear</i> a changing tone that gives you
immediate information about your physical responses.  In other
words, biofeedback is an electronic way of representing inner
processes externally that are usually automatic, involuntary, and
unconscious.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
PHYSICAL APPLICATIONS
</p>

<p>
Frequently, and relatively quickly, many people are able to
learn how to control many of their internal responses very well.
Biofeedback can sometimes be an alternative to using medication
to reduce tension or pain.  Its range of applications has
grown tremendously.  Here are some examples of its uses:
</p>

<p>
A woman was badly injured in an automobile accident.  On one
side of her face her facial nerve was severed, leaving her unable
to move any part of the left side of her face and unable to close
or blink her left eye.  Surgeons decided to splice the severed
facial nerve to a nerve in her neck-shoulder muscle.  Once this
was done, the woman could shrug or twitch her shoulder, and in
this way cause the paralyzed side of her face to move, and blink
her left eye.  However, the movements of the left side of her face
were uncoordinated, spastic, and not synchronous with the
movements of the uninjured right side of her face.
</p>

<p>
Biofeedback training seemed to offer a possible solution.
Electrodes were taped to the injured side of her face.  The
electrical activity of muscles in the damaged area was displayed
on a screen, along with the pattern that <i>would</i> be produced by
undamaged facial nerves and muscles.  The woman's task was to
watch the two patterns and somehow learn by inner experiment
how to control the left side of her face so its movements would
match the normal pattern and would then coordinate with
movements of the other side.
</p>

<p>
Her training lasted for several months.  Because of her persistence
and hard work, she was successful in learning to match the
"normal" pattern; she was now able to move the two sides of her
face in symmetrical harmony.
</p>

<p>
Other successful physical applications of biofeedback therapy
include these:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* controlling high blood pressure
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* learning to raise blood pressure in cases of spinal injuries
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
that block the automatic raising of blood pressure when a
person stands up (excessively low pressure causes them to
faint)
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* coping more effectively with asthma attacks
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* eliminating migraine headaches
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* helping children with cerebral palsy control muscle
spasms
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* helping stroke victims with proprioception problems (in
which they lose the sense of where their arms and legs are
in space)
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* teaching patients with circulation problems (e.g., blood
clots in the legs) to dilate their blood vessels, regaining
movement and reducing pain
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* assisting stutterers by helping them become aware of
unnecessary and interfering muscle contractions they have
come to make habitually when they speak and teaching
them how to relax these muscles
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* reducing tension and pain in arthritis patients
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To date, of all the areas to which it has been applied, biofeedback
has been <i>most</i> successful for patients who are physically
paralyzed or have movement disorders.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS
</p>

<p>
Biofeedback has been used successfully in psychotherapy in
these ways:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* teaching general relaxation methods, which can be useful
to many people who have problems that involve anxiety,
depression, or phobias
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* assisting people with insomnia, also through relaxation
techniques
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* teaching people how to recognize effective meditation by
making them aware of periods during sessions of
meditation when their brainwave patterns slow (see the
last section in this chapter, on meditation)
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Increasingly, biofeedback is being used to treat emotional
disorders in conjunction with both psychotherapy and medication.
It is one of the ways available to us to enlarge the range of
our conscious control over ourselves and our lives.

<p class="t3b">
RELAXATION TRAINING
<br /><br />
  <i>Primarily a coping strategy<br />
  to help people continue to function<br />
  in an environment of stress.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The pervasive phenomenon of stress is the hidden epidemic of
the United States and other highly industrialized countries.  It is
associated with high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries,
strokes, ulcers, colitis, and a host of other physical conditions.
And severe stress endured too long leads to emotional breakdown.
</p>

<p>
All physical materials can be loaded or stressed to a certain
point beyond which they distort, snap, fracture, or break.  Stress
loads human beings physically as well as emotionally.  Any
change&mdash;whether for good or for ill&mdash;is a stressor.  As human
beings, we are not simple engineering materials that form simple
cracks or breaks, and when stressful events are strong enough,
we begin to crack or break in ways that are considerably more
complex.  Physical disease, emotional disorders, and mental
illnesses are the cracks or breaks that occur in human "material."
</p>

<p>
Statistics show that common forms of severe stress <i>do</i> cause us
to break.  For example, compared with others the same age, ten
times more people die during the year following the death of
their husbands or wives.  In the year after a divorce, ex-spouses
have an illness rate twelve times higher than married people the
same ages.  In addition, chronic anger, anxiety, and depression
appear to weaken the body's immune system, increasing the
likelihood of serious disease.
</p>

<p>
Individuals do, of course, have different emotional breaking
points, but we know that prolonged high levels of anxiety erode
a person's psychological integration.  What results is "nervous
breakdown"&mdash;a term that is vague and means little more than a
blown fuse due to emotional overload.  The aftermath of such an
overload may leave a person with depression, anxiety, and the
inability to function "as usual" for a considerable period of time.
</p>

<p>
Relaxation training, along with the other therapies discussed
in this chapter, is an antidote or prevention for human breakage
brought about by excessive stress.  The central belief on which
relaxation training is based is that you cannot be tense and
anxious if you are physically very relaxed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
</p>

<p>
There are two main approaches to relaxation training.  (We
have already briefly discussed them in Chapter 12 in connection
with desensitization.)  In both approaches you begin by reclining
or lying down in a quiet room.  Relaxation can then be achieved
through tension and release or through suggestion.  In the
former, you tense a given muscle group, holding the tension for
five to ten seconds, then release the tension and experience the
relief from tension, or relaxation.  In the latter, you consciously
suggest to yourself that a group of muscles feels warm, heavy,
very heavy, and relaxed, sinking into the recliner or bed or floor.
Both approaches aim to achieve two things: to bring about deep,
progressive muscular relaxation and to increase your sensitivity
to the presence of tension in your body when it exists.
</p>

<p>
Relaxation training is a learned skill.  If you practice it
regularly&mdash;that is, daily, for at least several weeks&mdash;you can gain
increased control over your major muscle groups&mdash;those of the
arms, legs, shoulders, back, abdomen, neck, and face.  You
gradually learn to recognize even low levels of tension in these
muscles so that the tension can be eliminated consciously.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, as you learn how to control physical relaxation,
you are able to achieve deep relaxation in increasingly shorter
periods of time.  After regular practice over a period of months,
many people, when they face a suddenly upsetting situation, can
quickly offset their emotional and physical reactions to stress by
inducing a calm and relaxed state in themselves.  They are able to
neutralize the stressor's potential for doing damage.  If you can
learn to do this, you have learned a skill in controlling your own
life that is of great value.  It is a survival skill that can help you
protect yourself against being worn down by stressful events
that otherwise eventually lead to learned habits of anxiety
and tension.  Once formed, these habits can be very difficult to get
rid of.
</p>

<p>
For emotionally disturbed persons, relaxation training
techniques are useful primarily as an adjunct to psychotherapy or
drug therapy and can be helpful in reducing tension and anxiety.
They are ways of treating <i>symptoms</i>; they can help you continue
to cope with stressful situations.  It is another question whether
it is in your best interest to <i>continue</i> in a situation that causes
you enough stress that relaxation training becomes a needed
crutch.  Sometimes it is wiser to change an unsatisfactory
situation or to attempt to change your attitudes, values, or behavior
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
than it is to learn skills so that you can keep doing the same
stressful and perhaps unsatisfying thing day after day.  Relaxation
training is a <i>coping strategy</i>.  By itself, it cannot resolve the
fundamental question: whether it is better to learn how to numb
yourself to an unhappy situation, to leave it, or to face the
possibility that your stress is caused by inner conflicts and
unrealistic attitudes rather than external factors.
</p>

<p>
If you cannot or do not want to leave a stressful environment,
techniques of relaxation training may benefit you.  If you feel the
main problems are within you, then psychotherapy may be the
best alternative.  And sometimes, throwing in the towel, deciding
in favor of a change of career, marriage, place to live, or way of
life may be most therapeutic and personally fulfilling.
</p>

<p>
It can often be hard to know which alternative is best.
Counseling may help.  Talking with good friends may help.
Letting time pass may help.  Usually, ignoring discomfort will <i>not</i>
help; stress has a way of compounding and wearing you down.
Waiting too long, usually out of fear of facing a need for some
form of change, is itself a source of internal stress&mdash;of worry and
anxiety that will not go away until you do something to put a
stop to doing nothing.

HYPNOSIS
<br /><br />
  <i>An approach to therapy that can have<br />
  far-reaching beneficial effects for people with<br />
  many different kinds of problems, especially<br />
  useful for persons who are strongly motivated<br />
  to change and can feel a deep sense of<br />
  confidence in the humanity and competence<br />
  of their therapist.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Hypnosis is very old.  Ancient Egyptian records indicate that
priests maintained temples of sleep devoted to healing the ill and
troubled.  The priests are thought to have used hypnotic induction
of sleep and to have offered assurance that patients would
get well.
</p>

<p>
Many centuries later, Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815)
developed a method for inducing a hypnotic trance state (he
associated it with sleepwalking) and claimed that therapy often
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
was more effective when patients were in a trance.  Hypnosis was
later used by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) at the Paris
Hospital of SalpÃªtriÃ¨re; Charcot was one of Freud's teachers.
During World War II, hypnosis was used to treat soldiers with
amnesia, paralysis, and pain.  Since then, it has been used
frequently by clinical psychologists and psychotherapists.
</p>

<p>
Much is still not understood about the mental and physiological
mechanisms involved in hypnosis.  They are difficult to
define because they seem to assume many different forms in
different people, depending on their personalities and their
moods at the time.
</p>

<p>
Hypnosis probably occurs in daydreaming to some extent; it
probably is also involved when a mother lulls her child to sleep
or when a customer succumbs to suggestions from a salesperson.
We all seem to be&mdash;vaguely and to some degree&mdash;familiar with
the phenomenon, yet we remain, paradoxically, ignorant of its
existence.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT HYPNOSIS IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
For most people, the experience of hypnosis is something of a
letdown.  They anticipate that they will have an extraordinary experience in a trance state, and yet what actually happens is
very similar to their probably familiar experience of drifting into
a state of relaxed distraction from time to time when daydreaming.
Often what happens when we daydream is that our attention is focused on an
object, and we gradually relax and begin to drift into a state of
partial awareness.  The phone may then ring, but for a moment it
can be unclear whether we are just imagining this.
</p>

<p>
The hypnotic state induced by a trained hypnotherapist is very
similar.  When in a hypnotic trance, you never become
unconscious; your mind continues to be active.  As you go gradually
into a deeper trance, your breathing and heart rates tend to
slow, and you feel increasingly more deeply relaxed.  Usually, the
experience is one of being lulled into a state of calm repose.
Sometimes&mdash;for example, in former surgery patients who have
had unpleasant experiences with anesthesia&mdash;hypnosis may
cause people to become anxious or frightened and to refuse to
continue.
</p>

<p>
You relax physically while in a hypnotic trance.  You will slump
in your chair; your breathing becomes slow and deep; you move
very little.  In other cultures, however, trance states take very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
different forms.  Behavior may become ecstatic, even violent;
individuals may begin to dance frenetically and to spin about, as
in the case of Algerian dervishes.  But in Western society,
hypnotic trance usually takes the form of deep, passive relaxation.
</p>

<p>
After their first experience with hypnosis, most people tend to
disbelieve that they have really been in a trance state.  They
realize they have been pleasantly relaxed, but they feel that
"hypnosis" has not occurred.  Clients who are suspicious, hostile,
or feel threatened by the experience, or who do not trust the
therapist, tend to resist hypnosis.  Frequently, on the other hand,
clients who are extremely anxious and feel greatly in need of
help turn out to be especially good candidates for hypnosis.
</p>

<p>
If their first experience with hypnosis is comfortable, safe, and
pleasant, clients will usually allow themselves to drift into a
deeper trance state in subsequent sessions.
</p>

<p>
Many techniques exist to induce hypnosis.  Commonly, they
make use of the well-known method in which you are asked to fix
your attention on an object&mdash;a coin, a stone, a pendant&mdash;while
the hypnotherapist speaks softly in a monotone, suggesting that
you are relaxing ever more deeply, that your eyes are getting
heavy, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Milton H. Erickson (1901-1980) has been one of the leading
American contributors to recent developments in clinical hypnosis.
His ideas have been among the most creative, imaginative,
and subtle in the field.  He is well known for his <i>indirect</i>
induction techniques, which, because of the complex and
unusual perspective they reflect, we cannot deal with at any length
here.  They are techniques that frequently induce a trance state
<i>without</i> the client's being in the slightest way aware that this is
happening.  Dr. Erickson is often able to induce hypnosis only by
means of a <i>handshake</i>.  An example may give some general idea of
his approach.  Dr. Erickson describes this technique:
</p>

<p class="quote">
When I begin shaking hands, I do so normally.  The "hypnotic
touch" then begins when I let loose.  The letting loose becomes
transformed from a firm grip into a gentle touch by the thumb,
a lingering drawing away of the little finger, the faint brushing
of the subject's hand with the middle finger&mdash;just enough vague
sensation to attract the attention.  As the subject gives attention
to the touch with your thumb, you shift to a touch with your
little finger.  As your subject's attention follows that, you shift to
a touch with your middle finger and then again to the
thumb....
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
The subject's withdrawal from the handshake is arrested by
his attention arousal, which establishes ... an expectancy.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Then almost, but not quite simultaneously (to ensure
separate neural recognition), you touch the undersurface of the
hand (wrist) so gently that it barely suggests an upward push.
This is followed by a similar utterly slight downward touch,
and then I sever contact so gently that the subject does not
know exactly when&mdash;and the subject's hand is left going neither
up nor down, but cataleptic.  Sometimes I give a lateral and
medial touch so that the hand is even more rigidly
cataleptic....
</p>

<p class="quote">
There are several colleagues who won't shake hands with me,
unless I assure them first, because they developed a profound
glove anaesthesia when I used this procedure on them.  I shook
hands with them, looked them in the eyes, ... rapidly
immobilized my facial expression, and then focused my eyes on
a spot far behind them.  I then slowly and imperceptibly
removed my hand from theirs and slowly moved to one side out
of their direct line of vision.[<a id="chap15fn7text"></a><a href="#chap15fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Here is a characteristic reaction of one of Erickson's
colleagues to his procedure:
</p>

<p class="quote">
I had heard about you and I wanted to meet you and you
looked so interested and you shook hands so warmly.  All of a
sudden my arm was gone and your face changed and got so far
away.  Then the left side of your head began to disappear, and I
could see only the right side of your face until that slowly
vanished also....  Your face slowly came back, and you came
close and smiled....  Then I noticed my hand and asked you
about it because I couldn't feel my whole arm.  You said to keep
it that way just a little while for the experience.[<a id="chap15fn7text"></a><a href="#chap15fn7">7</a>]

</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
APPLICATIONS OF HYPNOSIS
</p>

<p>
It is much easier to bring about a hypnotic trance than to know
how to make effective therapeutic use of the trance state once it
is produced.  Depending on the depth of trance that you will
accept, these are the kinds of goals that can be achieved:
</p>

<p>
In a light trance, your eyes are closed, you are physically
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
relaxed, and it is possible to convey to you, for example, that you
are unable to move an arm.  At this stage, the therapist can often
be effective in offering you support and encouraging you to
begin to make changes in your behavior.
</p>

<p>
In a medium trance, relaxation is still deeper.  A partial
anesthesia of a hand or arm can be achieved, and you will comply
in a slow, semiautomatic way with instructions from the therapist.
In this state, many clients can learn rather quickly how to
bring about <i>self</i>-hypnosis, which they can then practice on their
own.  At this stage, it is sometimes possible to suggest gradual
personality changes.
</p>

<p>
In a deep trance, more extensive anesthesias are possible.  A
therapist can encourage you to experience emotional changes,
to hallucinate, and to regress to a younger age&mdash;i.e., to re-experience
memories of past events and to feel and behave as you did
at that time.  In a deep trance state, it is possible to use hypnotic
desensitization techniques to help you overcome anxieties and
fears.
</p>

<p>
Hypnotherapy lends itself well to use on your own.  Once you
have learned how to induce light trance states on your own, you
can begin to suggest certain attitudes, feelings, or behavioral
changes you would like to bring about in yourself.  Being
successful at this&mdash;as with any skill&mdash;requires regular practice and
regular and gradual strengthening of the habits that are being
formed.  Some psychotherapists will make a audio recording
for the individual client to use at home on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
Hypnosis has been used to treat many problems, including
these:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  ulcers<br />
  frigidity<br />
  impotence<br />
  headaches and migraines<br />
  insomnia<br />
  arthritic pain<br />
  colitis<br />
  tachycardia<br />
  obesity<br />
  depression<br />
  phobias<br />
  antisocial behavior<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  disturbed children<br />
  amnesia<br />
  stuttering<br />
  nervous tics<br />
  sexual inhibitions<br />
  dental anxiety and pain<br />
  heart palpitations<br />
  abdominal cramps<br />
  tension and anxiety<br />
  overeating<br />
  reduction or elimination of smoking<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Both men and women are equally hypnotizable.  Children are
generally better subjects than adults.  As already noted, clients
who are more anxious tend to accept hypnotic suggestion more
readily.  Clients who are motivated to change respond best to
hypnotic suggestion.  Individuals who are imaginative, who had
fictitious companions in childhood, who read a good deal, and
who can become readily absorbed in nature are inclined to make
good subjects.  Good rapport between client and therapist and a
sense of trust in the therapist's goodwill and ability contribute
greatly to successful hypnotherapy.
</p>

<p>
Russian-born Lewis R. Wolberg (1905-1988) was a leading New
York hypnotherapist originally trained as a psychoanalyst.
He is recognized for the comprehensiveness and eclecticism
of his approach.  After forty years of practice, he came to see its
main limitation:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Because hypnosis is so dramatic a phenomenon, it is easy to
overestimate its potential.  A great many things may be
accomplished with a subject in a trance, even the removal of
psychologically determined symptoms....  But almost
immediately after hypnosis has ended, or shortly thereafter, the
symptoms will return <i>if the subject has a psychological need
for them</i>. [italics added] ...
</p>

<p class="quote">
Quite often patients on disability compensation are sent to
me by insurance companies for hypnotic examination and
treatment.  Almost invariably, these casualties cling to their
symptoms with the desperation of a drowning man hanging on
to a raft....
</p>

<p class="quote">
There are other secondary gains a person may get out of
holding onto his symptoms.  The need to punish himself for his
guilt feelings, the desire to abandon an adult adjustment and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
return to the protective blanket of infancy in order to be taken
care of....  Symptoms do not magically vanish; they must be
worn down.  It is essential to replace them with productive
habits."[<a id="chap15fn8text"></a><a href="#chap15fn8">8</a>]

MEDITATION
<br /><br />
  <i>For individuals who are able to make a<br />
  long-range commitment to the practice of a<br />
  discipline that, over a period of many months<br />
  and years, can strengthen them and help them<br />
  to become more fully integrated and centered.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
Don't go outside yourself, return into yourself.  The dwelling
place of truth is the inner man.
<br /><br />
Saint Augustine, <i>The True Religion</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meditation is a systematic discipline that attempts to help
people move toward the goal of self-realization.  It is not the
creation of one individual or group.  Techniques of meditation
have evolved over many centuries and in different parts of the
world.  And yet these techniques bear striking similarities to
each other, whether they originated in the temples and
monasteries of India, Japan, Europe, or the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
Meditation is not a relaxed act of "contemplating one's navel";
it more closely resembles athletic training.  It is a form of
progressive mental exercise that has as its goal a strengthening
of a person's self-confidence, inner strength, and the mind's
ability to focus and concentrate.  Meditation takes considerable
endurance.  It is essentially a discipline.  It requires fortitude,
perseverance, and a strong will.  Like athletic ability, skills in
meditation cannot be developed without regular practice.
Because its effects are felt only gradually, meditation needs a
long-term commitment to sustain it, and this ultimately must be based
on faith in its eventual value.
</p>

<p>
The disciplined and regular practice of meditation over a
period of many months appears to lead to a sense of personal
integration, a sense of being more firmly <i>centered</i> in yourself,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
more confident and aware of your connection with all that is.
Experienced practitioners of meditation claim to feel a greater
degree of personal security; they feel more at ease with themselves.
They claim to feel serenity, zest in living, and inner peace
and joy in work, which they seem to be able to do more
efficiently, with greater energy and interest.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Techniques of meditation share the goal of disciplining the
mind to do one thing at a time.  Until you have made a serious
attempt to meditate, you will very likely be unaware of how
perpetually distracted your attention is.  We seldom make the
effort to stand apart from our thoughts, to take note of how
numerous and varied they are and how chaotically they tumble
into and out of our consciousness.  It is exceedingly hard work to
quiet these "chattering monkeys of the mind."  Quieting the
overactive and undisciplined mind is a challenging task.  It takes
energy and a great deal of practice.
</p>

<p>
There are many approaches to meditation.  Here, we will look
at three.[<a id="chap15fn9text"></a><a href="#chap15fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap15fn9"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn9text">9</a>] See the excellent introduction to the practice of meditation
by Lawrence LeShan, <i>How to Meditate: A Guide to Self-Discovery</i>
(Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co.,
1974).  Dr. LeShan is a psychotherapist in New York City
who teaches many of his
clients meditation as part of their therapy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Breath Counting</i>
</p>

<p>
Breath counting is one way to train your mind to control and
focus attention.  The object is to be doing one thing, and one
thing only, becoming fully involved in that single purpose.  Start
by finding a comfortable position, sitting or lying down.  Place a
clock or watch where you can see it without having to turn your
head.  Usually with eyes closed, you then begin to count your
breaths, silently: "one" as you slowly exhale the first breath,
two as you exhale the second, etc.  After you get to "four" start
with "one" again.  The purpose is to be doing <i>only</i> this, only
breathing and counting.  You will quickly find that your mind
rebels; it will stray and wander whenever your concentration
and attention falter.  It is a recalcitrant entity.  You will be doing
well in the beginning if you can succeed for only a few seconds
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
at a time in being conscious <i>only</i> of your counting.  Distractions
will subvert your will in a split second.  You will find yourself
thinking of a host of things: what to do tomorrow morning,
whether you are doing well or badly at meditation, whether it is
silly to be doing this, what's for dinner, taxes, work, or that itch
on your forehead.  Again and again you will have to return your
mind to the task at hand.  Very quickly, you'll begin to realize that
meditation <i>is</i> hard work.  It is frustrating and demanding.
</p>

<p>
Practice doing this for fifteen minutes a day.  After a few weeks,
increase to twenty minutes.  After another four weeks, spend
twenty-five to thirty minutes a day.  Once you can do this,
continue to practice daily for another month.  It will take that
long before you will begin to sense whether this approach to
meditation is going to be useful to you.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Meditation of Contemplation</i>
</p>

<p>
This is an alternative approach to meditation.  Again, the
purpose is to discipline your mind by means of focused attention.
In this approach, you try to focus attention on a physical
object.  Pick a natural object&mdash;a shell, a small stone, a pressed
leaf.  Now, with the object a foot or two from you, simply <i>look</i> at
it.  The purpose is to look at the object actively, to keep your
attention fixed on it, but to be wakeful and alert.  Do not stare at
one place on the object or strain your eyes.  Explore the object,
<i>look</i> at it, attend to it.  As usual, you'll find plenty to distract
you&mdash;stiffness, the need to move, sleepiness, slipping into
thinking about problems you need to solve.  Each time your mind
drifts out of track, gently bring your attention back to the object.
Try this for ten minutes a day for two weeks, then fifteen minutes
a day for a month, then twenty minutes for the next month.  By
then, you will know if this approach will help you.  Be prepared
for some effective sessions and some discouraging ones.  Remember
that no one said meditation would be easy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Meditation of the Bubble</i>
</p>

<p>
This is an ancient form of meditation that, again, seeks to
discipline the mind by developing your ability to focus on one
thing at a time.  In this meditation, you concentrate on your own
stream of consciousness.  Imagine yourself sitting quietly on the
bottom of a clear lake.  Each of your thoughts and feelings forms
a bubble that slowly rises to the surface of the lake.  As each
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
comes to your mind, watch it closely and think only of it for the
five seconds or so that it takes to rise to the surface.  Be aware of
the slow rhythm of the bubbles.  Try to spend approximately
equal amounts of time attending to each bubble.  If the same
thought, the same bubble, rises several times, this is OK.  If you
continue, the repetition will pass.  If nothing comes to mind for
a time, this, too, is OK.  Form an empty bubble.  Try this
meditation for ten minutes a day for two weeks, then increase to twenty
minutes a day for one or two months.  By then, you will know if
this approach to meditation is beneficial to you.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE BENEFITS OF MEDITATION
</p>

<p>
How <i>will</i> you recognize whether an approach to meditation
has value for you?  Any changes that occur in you will be gradual;
you must be patient.  If, after most sessions of meditation, you
feel generally more integrated, calmer, more at ease, this is a
good sign.  Over a period of time, if you are working hard at an
approach to meditation that seems to fit your temperament,
these periods of feeling peaceful, alert, and comfortable in the
world will gradually become more evident to you.
</p>

<p>
Physiologically, meditation appears to lead to a deeply relaxed
state of alert concentration.  Your respiration and heart rates
slow, the level of lactate in the blood (associated with tension
and anxiety) drops lower, and there is an increase in slow alpha
brain waves, associated with profound relaxation.
</p>

<p>
What is important, no matter what approach to meditation you
try, is to stay with that approach long enough to determine its
potential value for you.  Doing a meditation once or a few times
is like jogging once or twice: you can't expect to derive any
benefit from exercising a couple of times.  Meditation is the
practice and expression of discipline; deciding to practice
regularly and then carrying out your decision are just as
important as the approach you take to meditation.

  DRUG AND NUTRITION<br />
  THERAPIES<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  DRUG THERAPY:<br />
  BALANCING EMOTIONS WITH CHEMISTRY<br />
<br />
  <i>Often especially helpful to people who are<br />
  emotionally very upset so that they may begin<br />
  to benefit from psychotherapy.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the past thirty years, biochemistry and pharmacology
have made many important contributions to the treatment of
mental and emotional disorders.  There is no question that
<i>psychotropic</i>&mdash;literally "mind-turning" or mind-influencing&mdash;drugs
can help many people during periods of emotional or
mental suffering.
</p>

<p>
Psychotropic drugs can be used by themselves or in conjunction
with psychotherapy.  Frequently, drugs are used to help
reduce the severity of symptoms in patients so that they may
benefit from psychotherapy.  Effective psychotherapy requires
you to be comparatively calm, rational, and able to make
well-thought-out decisions.  These things are not possible if you are
terribly agitated, are despondent and crying much of the time, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
may, for example, have disturbing hallucinations and are no longer in touch
with reality.
</p>

<p>
The aim of drug therapy is, eventually, to eliminate the need
for medication.  In this respect, psychopharmacology is similar to
psychotherapy: both would like to help the patient so that he or she no
longer needs either one.  It is not always possible to do this,
however.  Some disorders are, at present anyway, chronic
conditions.  People with parkinsonism or epilepsy may have to take
medication indefinitely.  But the general trend is to use
psychotropic drugs as temporary measures to bring symptoms quickly
under control so that psychotherapy can be started.
</p>

<p>
The only professionals who are legally authorized to prescribe
psychotropic drugs are physicians and, in particular, psychiatrists.
However, psychotherapists are now being trained to be
sensitive to conditions that may have an organic basis.  Certainly,
it is wise to have a thorough physical exam to rule out organic
problems that can cause emotional or mental upset (see Chapter
8).  Numerous studies have shown that up to half of the
individuals who are referred to a psychotherapist have undiagnosed
organic problems.[<a id="chap16fn1text"></a><a href="#chap16fn1">1</a>]  This is an important caution to bear in mind.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap16fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap16fn1text">1</a>] See, for example, L. Small, <i>Neuropsychodiagnosis in Psychotherapy</i>
(New York: Brunner/Mazel, 1980).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
TYPES OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS
</p>

<p>
There are nine main classes of psychotropic drugs:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Antianxiety, or Anxiolytic, Drugs</i>
</p>

<p>
These are the so-called <i>minor tranquilizers</i>.  They are sedatives
for the waking hours that are prescribed for people who
have excessive tension and anxiety.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Neuroleptics, or Antipsychotics</i>
</p>

<p>
Psychosis is a disorder that impairs a person's abilities to
think, remember, communicate, respond with appropriate emotions,
and interpret reality without great distortion.  People who
have these difficulties can often be treated effectively with
neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs, also known as the <i>major
tranquilizers</i>, which have specific effects on the brain's activity.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Sedative-Hypnotic Drugs</i>
</p>

<p>
These drugs act as sedatives at low doses and produce a
"hypnotic" action at higher doses.  (The word <i>hypnotic</i> as used
by pharmacologists does not refer to a hypnotic trance but
means simply that a drug causes drowsiness and reduces motor
activity.)  In even larger doses, these drugs act as anesthetics.
Antianxiety drugs, the minor tranquilizers, can be grouped with
these drugs because of their sedative effect.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Antidepressants</i>
</p>

<p>
These drugs are used primarily to treat what psychiatrists call
<i>endogenous</i> depression&mdash;that is, major, incapacitating depression
that is not associated with an outside event or situation.
Depressions that occur after the loss of a job, the death of
someone close, or some other external event are called
<i>exogenous</i> depressions.  They can sometimes be treated
effectively with antidepressants, but drug therapy for
<i>situation-induced depression</i> generally is less successful.
</p>

<p>
Lithium therapy is a specific treatment primarily for manic-depressive
disorders.  Lithium carbonate is a naturally occurring
mineral salt.  For manic-depressive patients&mdash;with wide swings of
mood from feeling extremely energetic and emotionally high to
feeling seriously depressed&mdash;lithium therapy may offer help as a
mood stabilizer.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Stimulants</i>
</p>

<p>
Caffeine and nicotine are the best known of the stimulants.  In
therapy, stimulants are used in the treatment of narcolepsy
(individuals suddenly fall asleep for short periods of time, even
when engaged in activities), some forms of epilepsy, and,
paradoxically, hyperkinetic children (who are excessively active and
have short attention spans and explosive irritability).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Antiepileptic Drugs</i>
</p>

<p>
For many of the two million Americans with epilepsy, these
antiseizure drugs are very helpful.  Epilepsy does not tend to
shorten an individual's life, but it is a severe, troubling, and often
disabling condition for which drug therapy can be a blessing.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Antiparkinsonian Drugs</i>
</p>

<p>
These drugs have helped the lives of many people who are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
affected by the characteristic involuntary tremors of this disease,
which can cause abnormalities in gait and trembling of the
voluntary muscles.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Psychedelics</i>
</p>

<p>
Psychedelic drugs are also called <i>hallucinogens</i>.  They
produce altered states of consciousness and sensory distortions.
Psychedelics have no established use in psychiatry at present in
the United States.  Great Britain and Canada, however, have
experimented with psychedelics in the treatment of alcoholics,
whom they sometimes appear to help.  Psychedelics have also
sometimes been used for the terminally ill and in certain cases of
autism.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Drugs for Headache, Migraine, and Neuralgia</i>
</p>

<p>
Drugs for these common kinds of pain are widespread.
Migraines (which may cause blurred vision, vertigo, and even
temporary deafness) and cluster headaches (which cause severe
pain around the eyes, tearing and reddening of the eyes, and
runny nose) frequently can be treated successfully with specific
drugs.  Neuralgias are recurrent knifelike facial and head pains
that can last for days and even months.  They can be difficult to treat
successfully.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT DRUG THERAPY IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
In this section, we'll look at some of the main emotional and
mental symptoms that are often helped by means of drug
therapy.  Since all medications have potential side effects, we will
look at these as well.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Anxiety</i>
</p>

<p>
Excessive anxiety causes very unpleasant symptoms: dizziness
or light-headedness, sweating, pounding heart, vomiting,
diarrhea, shaking, muscle tension, inability to sleep.  Many of these
symptoms can be controlled by antianxiety drugs.  All of these
drugs can lead to psychological dependence when they are used
regularly over periods of time that vary with the person and the
medication.  For this reason, they are normally used for short
periods, often at the beginning of psychotherapy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
</p>

<p>
The most commonly prescribed antianxiety drugs include
these (trade names):
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Atarax<br />
  Ativan<br />
  Centrax<br />
  Clonopin<br />
  Dalmane<br />
  Doriden<br />
  Equanil<br />
  Librium<br />
  Loxitane<br />
  Paxipam<br />
  Restoril<br />
  Serax<br />
  Tranxene<br />
  Tybatran<br />
  Valium<br />
  Valmid<br />
  Xanax<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Although relatively small percentages of patients experience
them, as with most drugs, there may be side effects, including
drowsiness, impaired judgment and performance, nausea/vomiting,
ataxia (loss of voluntary muscle coordination), and agitation
(paradoxical restlessness).
</p>

<p>
Patients who have taken an antianxiety drug for a period of
time are often instructed to reduce their dosage gradually to
avoid mild, infrequently severe, withdrawal symptoms.
</p>

<p>
Antianxiety drugs can reduce agitation and produce a relative
sense of calm.  But, unfortunately, patients usually develop a
tolerance to any antianxiety drug after three to four months, and
then the drug loses its effectiveness.  Antianxiety drugs are
usually limited, then, to short-term treatment.  Long-term
recovery from the symptoms of anxiety is the task of psychotherapy: to
help clients change their attitudes, behavior, or way of life.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Depression</i>
</p>

<p>
Depression can be a seriously incapacitating emotional disorder.
Depression can range from a lingering sense of sadness or
grief to a feeling of utter hopelessness, guilt, despondency,
uncontrollable crying, and suicidal thoughts.  The following
symptoms are typical: insomnia or early waking, loss of appetite
and loss of interest in sex, inability to concentrate, great
difficulty in making decisions, and a reduced desire and ability
to assume job and family responsibilities.  Though depression is
called "the common cold of emotional illness," it is not to be
taken lightly, since severe depression is life-threatening, as many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
suicides testify.  Depression affects one out of five people during
their lifetimes; more women suffer from depression than men.
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing,[<a id="chap16fn2text"></a><a href="#chap16fn2">2</a>] the most widely prescribed
antidepressants are the tricyclics.
They are most effective in treating endogenous depressions;
MAO inhibitors (see below) are more useful in cases of "atypical"
depression, which frequently is associated with a situation
the patient cannot come to terms with, such as the loss of a job
or of a loved one.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap16fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap16fn2text">2</a>] Since this book was published, SSRIs or <i>s</i>elective <i>s</i>erotonin
<i>r</i>euptake <i>i</i>nhibitors, have become the most commonly prescribed
antidepressant medication in the U.S and many other countries.
For readers interested in more information about SSRIs, see Wikipedia's
article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tricyclic antidepressants include these (trade names):
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Avenyl<br />
  Elavil<br />
  Norpramin<br />
  Pamelor<br />
  Sinequan<br />
  Surmontil<br />
  Tofranil<br />
  Vivactil<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Approximately 70 percent of patients who take tricyclics
improve.  Several newer drugs&mdash;the tetracyclics, dibenzoxapines,
and triazolopyridenes&mdash;are similar to the tricyclics in
their effects.  They include these (trade names):
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Asedin<br />
  Desyrel<br />
  Ludiomil<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If tricyclics do not help, MAO inhibitors (<i>m</i>onoamine <i>o</i>xidase
<i>i</i>nhibitors) are usually tried.  MAO inhibitors must be used with
great caution because they can interact with certain foods,
beverages, or drugs to produce severe high blood pressure.
Many foods and beverages are prepared by fermentation processes;
e.g., cheese, anchovies, pickled herring, pastrami, olives,
beer, and wine, all of which patients who take MAO inhibitors
must avoid.  These foods and beverages contain a chemical
compound, an amine called <i>tyramine</i>, which can cause dangerously
high blood pressure, a hypertensive crisis, in people taking
an MAO inhibitor.  Furthermore, MAO inhibitors cannot be taken
with antihistamines; patients who take MAO inhibitors may be
warned to avoid other drug interactions.  These warnings should
be taken seriously because MAO inhibitors are one of the most
potentially <i>toxic</i> groups of psychoactive drugs.  Yet they can
make the difference between night and day for many cases of
depression.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
</p>

<p>
There are common side effects caused by all the antidepressants
we've mentioned, including an uncomfortably dry mouth,
dizziness, especially when standing up quickly, headaches,
difficulty in urinating, nausea/vomiting, constipation or diarrhea,
impotence, inability to reach orgasm, agitation/shaking, and rapid
heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
Some of these side effects can be annoying but will often
diminish or disappear once the patient becomes accustomed to
the medication.  When side effects are not tolerable, the physician
or psychiatrist will usually prescribe a different antidepressant
that may have fewer, or no, side effects for a given patient.
</p>

<p>
One of the drawbacks of antidepressants is that there is a
waiting period of days or weeks before physician and patient
know whether a particular drug is going to help.  If, after four to
six weeks, an antidepressant has not reduced a patient's depression,
then a second drug may be tried, and, again, there will be
a delay of days or weeks before it is clear whether the medication
is going to work.  One needed area of research in psychopharmacology
is to devise tests that will help to tell a doctor what
antidepressant is most likely to be effective for the individual
patient.  At present, though some general guidelines exist,
matching patient with an effective and tolerable medication is a
process of intelligent trial and error.
</p>

<p>
Lithium has been used to treat manic depression since 1954.
Lithium is absorbed quickly from the gastrointestinal tract, but it
acts slowly, so it also takes time to know if it is going to be of
value.  Blood levels of lithium need to be checked once or twice
a week during the first month, twice a month for the next month
or two, and then once every one to two months.
</p>

<p>
Lithium is sometimes helpful in treating chronic simple depression,
that is, depression that is not associated with periodic
"highs."
</p>

<p>
Unlike most drugs used in psychiatry, lithium usually has few
noticeable side effects and does not tend to produce a feeling of
sedation or stimulation.  When side effects occur, it is usually
because the lithium level in the blood has become excessive.
Side effects then can include vomiting, lack of coordination,
muscular weakness, or drowsiness.
</p>

<p>
In addition to antidepressant drugs, electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT) is sometimes used to treat severe depression, as it is to
treat some other conditions, including schizophrenia.  Although
ECT is not itself a form of drug therapy, it is important to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
mention it here since it is one of the main <i>medical</i> treatments (as
opposed to the "talk therapies" of psychotherapy) used by
psychiatry today.  ECT is administered after a patient has been
sedated and given a general anesthetic.
</p>

<p>
The main advantage of ECT is that it acts much faster than any
of the antidepressants.  For a seriously suicidal patient, this can
be important.
</p>

<p>
The main disadvantages of ECT are that it can cause temporary
memory loss, temporary disorientation and confusion after
treatment, and possible permanent changes in brain function&mdash;regarded
by many psychiatrists as "subtle," i.e., fairly minor.
Another discouraging finding is that depression recurs after ECT
in many patients&mdash;in up to 46 percent within six months after
ECT.
</p>

<p>
ECT has received "poor press."  As now administered, the
actual treatment is painless.  It is, nevertheless, a forceful,
"invasive" approach, so many psychiatrists prefer not to use it if
medication can be successful.  As more biochemical methods of
treatment are discovered, ECT very likely will be used less and
less.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Psychosis</i>
</p>

<p>
Psychosis is the most serious and incapacitating degree of
mental illness.  Emotional problems with symptoms of anxiety or
depression, or both together, are called <i>affective disorders</i>.
People who have affective disorders make up the majority of
clients seen by most psychotherapists; these clients are <i>not</i> out
of touch with reality.  The problems that they have&mdash;though
painful and sometimes obstacles to normal living&mdash;are essentially
different from the difficulties that patients with psychoses
have.  Though there is no unanimity about this among health care
professionals, we will distinguish between these two kinds of
problems by calling a psychosis a <i>mental illness</i>, as opposed to
an <i>emotional disorder</i>.  It is a matter not only of degree but of
kind.  A person who is severely depressed or extremely anxious is
usually still able to communicate rationally, and distinguish what
is real from what is fantasy or delusion.
</p>

<p>
Psychoses, on the other hand, are disorders that impair a
person's abilities to think, remember, communicate, respond
with appropriate emotions, interpret reality coherently, and
behave in a reasonably "normal" way.  People with psychoses
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
often have difficulty controlling their impulses, and their moods
may change quickly and radically.  Psychotic individuals often
believe things to be true that are not, and they may hear sounds
or voices that are not there.
</p>

<p>
There are many theories about the causes of psychosis.  Recently,
research studies in psychiatry have shown that psychosis
may be due to an excess of certain chemical substances called
<i>neurotransmitters</i> (such as norepinephrine or dopamine) in the
brain.  Another theory is that the brain of a psychotic person may
be excessively sensitive to the action of certain neurotransmitters.
</p>

<p>
The antipsychotic drugs, or neuroleptics, reduce the brain's
sensitivity to one or more of these chemical substances.  Some of
the best-known antipsychotic drugs are these (trade names):
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Compazine<br />
  Haldol<br />
  Mellaril<br />
  Prolixin<br />
  Stelazine<br />
  Thorazine<br />
  Trilafon<br />
  Vesprin<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Antipsychotic drugs frequently can clear thought processes,
reduce or end hallucinations, relieve agitation and anxiety, and
generally help patients return to the world of reality, communicate
with others, and behave in a more reasonable and stable
way.
</p>

<p>
Antipsychotic drugs have many possible side effects.  They may
produce drowsiness, dizziness and nausea, fainting, muscle
tremors, a shuffling gait, blurred vision, insomnia, sensitivity of
the skin to sunlight, and other effects.  Particularly disturbing
side effects can often be avoided by changing to a different
medication.  Some people with psychotic symptoms may need to
take antipsychotic medication for only a few weeks or months.
Recurrent or chronic illnesses, however, may require drug
treatment over a long period.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHEN DRUG THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE
</p>

<p>
Since psychotropic drugs can be prescribed only by a physician
or psychiatrist, his or her judgment will determine whether
a patient's difficulties seem to lend themselves to drug therapy.
In cases involving serious anxiety, depression, or psychosis, it is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
routine to expect drug therapy to be used, often in conjunction
with psychotherapy.  As we noted earlier, it is the hope of drug
therapy that it will be needed only temporarily, but some
chronic or periodically recurring conditions may be best treated
by continued medication for a number of years.  Since many of
the psychotropic drugs are new, it is not known whether
long-term use by some patients may ultimately affect their health
adversely.  Unless we decide to do without medication that can
be a blessing in relieving great suffering, until long-term studies
can be completed, the potential risks are there.  It is a matter of
weighing alternatives: on the one hand, perhaps incapacitating
emotional or mental distress, and on the other, side effects that
cannot be fully predicted.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THERAPY THROUGH NUTRITION
</p>

<p>
There is no question that nutritional deficiencies can
influence the functioning of the brain and affect the personality.
There are clear-cut cases, for example, of vitamin deficiencies
that result in symptoms of psychological disturbance.  The
majority of these cases involve people who suffer from very evident
malnutrition.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the connection between nutrition and mental
health is still vague; biochemists are becoming more aware of the
need to take into account <i>individual variations</i>.  It is not always
possible to specify exactly how much of a mineral, a vitamin, or
an amino acid a person requires for good health.  Some people,
for many different reasons, cannot effectively utilize the food
they eat.  Others have allergic reactions to certain foods; some
allergic reactions appear to be subtle, affecting a person's
moods.  Still other people seem to be especially sensitive to only
moderate changes in their blood sugar levels.  We have a great
deal in common as biological organisms.  Yet our biochemistries
may be finely tuned in individual ways that would require a
detailed and sophisticated understanding of an immense number
of interrelated factors that boggle the mind in complexity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Psychonutrition</i> has a long road to follow before it will be a
science.  So-called holistic or orthomolecular (the "right"
molecule) physicians and psychiatrists attempt to take individual
variations and sensitivities into account.  The need to do this may
be essential in many cases, but dependable and exact methods of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
evaluation and treatment simply do not exist as yet.  Except in
cases of outright malnutrition, finding connections between
nutrition and emotional health is still an art.
</p>

<p>
Some orthomolecular psychiatrists appear to have been
dramatically successful in helping some patients with certain mental
or emotional problems.  But because psychonutrition is still a
borderline discipline, it is an area where controversies abound
and results are often open to question.
</p>

<p>
Many physical conditions can be influenced greatly by
nutrition.  Among these are the metabolic disorders diabetes and
hypoglycemia, both of which can affect a person's emotional life
(see Chapter 8).  In addition, relationships have recently been
discovered between lowered blood pressure, reduced cholesterol
and triglyceride levels, and a diet high in fiber.  A thiamine
(vitamin B1) deficiency&mdash;which causes pellagra, a chronic disease
that leads to skin lesions and gastrointestinal distress&mdash;can
produce depression, mania, and paranoia.  Another example is
pernicious anemia, in large part due to vitamin B12 shortage,
which can cause moodiness, difficulty in remembering and
concentrating, violent behavior, depression, and hallucinations.
But the fact that many physical disorders, some of which can
cause psychological disturbances, are treatable in part through
nutrition does not, unfortunately, imply that emotional disorders
in general can be treated by means of diet.  This may be the case
for some individuals for whom special diets can influence a
specific biochemical imbalance.  But research is just beginning to
develop tests that can detect these sensitive individual variations.
Once they can be identified a more difficult step has to be
made: to determine how this information can be used to select
an effective treatment.
</p>

<p>
Nutritionists and physicians agree that good physical and
mental health depend on a combination of proper body weight,
adequate exercise, good diet, and decreased stress.  But beyond
this, an emotionally disturbed person who seeks help through
dietary therapy&mdash;for example, through megavitamin doses&mdash;should
realize that he or she is really involved in <i>self-experimentation</i>.
Some orthomolecular psychiatrists may be very talented
in treating some of their patients.  These patients are very
fortunate; it is hard to avoid saying they are lucky.  The main
problem that faces this new area of psychonutrition is one of
general reliability and credibility.

LOCATING A THERAPIST
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote2">
America is overcrowded with helpers; there are so many
helpful people out there, they are literally bumping into each
other, and must be regulated by laws and organizations to
keep them from helping so much that the average client in
need of help isn't torn to shreds.
<br /><br />
Paul G. Quinnett, <i>The Troubled People Book</i>
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
This chapter assumes that you have used one of the two methods
described in Chapter 7, "Self-Diagnosis: Mapping Your Way to a
Therapy," and have now chosen an approach to therapy that
seems most promising in relation to your goals or problems and
your personality.  You now face the practical problem of how to
locate a therapist with the professional expertise to offer you the
kind of help you desire.
</p>

<p>
There are three factors that you need to take into account in
order to find a suitable therapist:
</p>

<p class="point">
1. the degree of seriousness of your problem or need
</p>

<p class="point">
2. any financial limitations you may have
</p>

<p class="point">
3. the resources available where you live (or how far you are
willing to travel if you cannot locate the help you want in
your area)
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
</p>

<p>
The seriousness of your problem or need may fall into one of
three general categories:
</p>

<p>
<i>Very urgent need</i>: You are severely upset, perhaps suicidal or
dangerous to others.  Or, you are suffering from extreme changes
of mood or personality, major depression, delusions, or hallucinations.
In either of these cases, you should see a professional
immediately.  You or a friend or relative should contact your family
physician for a referral to a <i>psychiatrist</i> or call a crisis intervention
center for a referral to a psychiatrist.  (Crisis intervention
centers, sometimes called <i>suicide prevention centers</i> or <i>crisis
hot lines</i> are listed among the emergency numbers on the inside
front page of your White Pages directory; otherwise, dial 911 for assistance.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Serious personal, marital, or family problems or goals</i>: You,
you and your spouse, or members of your family need help soon
but can wait for an appointment, if necessary, for a number of
weeks.
</p>

<p>
<i>Moderate need</i>: There is no urgency.  You are interested,
before you consider formal therapy, in exploring some
alternatives&mdash;perhaps by talking with a minister, priest, or rabbi or by
trying one of the adjunctive approaches to therapy (such as
therapeutic exercise, meditation, relaxation training) on its
own, without individual therapy.
</p>

<p>
This chapter is intended primarily for people in the
well-populated middle category, people who have serious problems
or goals and are able to weigh alternatives carefully and without
extreme pressure.
</p>

<p>
The seriousness of the problem and the cost of treatment go
hand in hand.  The range of treatment alternatives is shown in the
table below.
</p>

<pre>
  <i>Condition          Cost                    Treatment by:</i>

In general, the less serious the problem, the lower the potential
cost of treatment.  Also, the more serious the condition, the
more advisable it is to have at least a preliminary evaluation by a
psychiatrist.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
  FINDING A THERAPIST WITH A<br />
  PARTICULAR SPECIALIZATION<br />
</p>

<p>
During a time of increasing specialization in health care, many
psychotherapists have unfortunately been attracted to
eclecticism&mdash;that is, knowing a reasonable amount about a number of
different forms of therapy, but resisting specialization in any one
of them.  For some individuals, especially people interested in
wide-spectrum growth and personal development, an eclectic
therapist can be very beneficial.  Eclectic therapists believe that
they are able to bring a wider scope of understanding to bear on
a problem and a more flexible outlook.  If you have fairly
well-defined needs and interests, however, eclecticism makes it
difficult to locate a therapist who has formal training and
extensive experience specifically in treating, for example,
depression, alcoholism, family conflicts, or adjustment problems.
No therapist today can be an expert in the whole range of human
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
emotional problems and in the many specialized techniques that
have been developed to help.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
REFERRALS
</p>

<p>
There are a number of ways of going about locating a therapist.
You can start by asking for a recommendation from any of
these sources:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* your family doctor, who will most likely suggest a
colleague, another M.D., a psychiatrist
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* your minister, priest, or rabbi, who again will suggest
someone he or she happens to know or to have heard of
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* personal friends
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* referral services
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All of these alternatives are, however, limited by the scope of
acquaintance of the person or service you have gone to.  Referral
services commonly are run by groups of subscribing psychologists
(or social workers), so if you call one, you will be referred
to a participating psychologist (or social worker).  Sometimes
referral services (which usually charge nothing for their referrals,
unless you request a preliminary consultation) maintain a
listing of the areas of specialization of their professional
members, and this information can be helpful.
</p>

<p>
If you have a specific approach to therapy in mind and want to
find a therapist with strong credentials in that approach, there
are two usually more promising roads to follow:
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BY MAIL, OR E-MAIL (GOOGLE ANY OF THE <br />
NAMES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOLLOW):
</p>

<p>
First, depending on your own judgment of the seriousness of
your problems or goals and the extent to which the cost of
treatment is important to you, you can request a list of
therapists in your area from these organizations:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  American Psychiatric Association<br />

</p>

<p class="noindent">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ask for a list that shows their specialties.  If none is available,
ask for the address of the branch office nearest you, which you
then can contact for this information.  If writing by mail, be sure to enclose a
stamped, self-addressed envelope to ensure a response.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
BY TELEPHONE
</p>

<p>
A second way to locate a therapist with specialization in a
particular area is through careful use of your telephone
directory.  This may take you some time, and also some preliminary
calls, but it can give you a good deal of information:
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Psychiatrists</i>
</p>

<p>
Psychiatrists are listed in the Yellow Pages under "Physicians
and Surgeons."  In larger metropolitan directories, you will
usually find separate headings after the general listing, according
to specialties.  Look there for "Physicians-Psychiatrists" or similar heading.  Many
psychiatrists today will list their special focus there&mdash;for
example, psychoanalysis, psychoanalytic psychotherapy (brief
analysis), marriage and family therapy, hypnosis, chemical
dependency treatment, child and adolescent therapy.  If you want to see
a psychiatrist and do not find one who indicates the specialized
approach you want to try, then you will need to make some calls.
Most psychiatrists' secretaries or receptionists are happy to tell
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
you what the doctor specializes in.  If the list of his or her areas
of specialization is impressively and overly long, perhaps it is
best to look elsewhere for a more realistic professional.
</p>

<p>
If, after locating a psychiatrist with the background you are
looking for, you want to double-check his or her credentials, ask
the secretary if the psychiatrist is a member of the American
Psychiatric Association (or, if in Canada, the Canadian
Psychiatric Association), whether he or she completed a program of
study at an institute of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis, and
whether he or she is board certified.  (Remember, any M.D. can
call himself or herself a psychiatrist, but not all have the full
qualifications of a certified psychiatrist.)
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Clinical Psychologists</i>
</p>

<p>
Clinical psychologists are listed in the Yellow Pages under
"Psychologists."  Their specialties are often identified&mdash;e.g.,
marriage and family therapy, group therapy, bereavement,
alcoholism, eating disorders and addiction, psychological assessment
(testing), learning disorders, sexual dysfunction, depression,
panic syndrome.  Again, if the list below a given psychologist's
name is unreasonably long, you may have come across either a
genius or someone who favors advertising.  Psychologists less
often mention the particular approach to therapy they use, but
some do; for example, behavior therapy, Gestalt, hypnosis, or
"analytical approach" may be listed.  Again, it will probably be
necessary to make a few telephone calls.
</p>

<p>
If, after locating a psychologist with the background you are
looking for, you want to double-check his or her credentials, you
can frequently find a copy in your public library of the <i>National
Register of Health Services Providers</i> or, in Canada, either the
<i>Canadian Registry of Health Service Providers in Psychology</i> or
the <i>International Directory of Psychologists</i>.  They list licensed
psychologists with Ph.D.s who have completed internships of
supervised therapy.  Psychologists will often print their state
license numbers in their telephone directory listings.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Social Work Counselors</i>
</p>

<p>
Social work counselors are listed under "Social Workers" in
the Yellow Pages.  Usually, their listings are less specific than
those for psychiatrists and psychologists.  Most commonly, you
will see listings indicating "licensed MFCC" (marriage, family,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
and child counseling), "MSW" (master's degree in social work),
"LCSW" (licensed clinical social worker), etc.  State licensing
numbers are often also given.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Register of Clinical Social Workers</i>, published by the
National Association of Social Workers, lists members whose
degrees and supervised training were in counseling; it is
available in many public libraries.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Specific credentials you may also see in directory listings
include the following:

<p class="t3">
HARDER-TO-FIND THERAPIES
</p>

<p>
It can be especially difficult or confusing to locate therapists
with certain orientations, either because these approaches are
less widespread or because you do not know which kinds of
health-care professionals make the greatest use of them.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, an effective way to locate an <i>existential-humanistic
therapist</i> or <i>logotherapist</i> is through religious organizations.
Call to ask for the names of ministers, priests, or rabbis with
training in psychotherapy or counseling.  These individuals, in
turn, will often be able to put you in touch with either
existential-humanistic therapists or logotherapists who may or may not
be affiliated with the religious organization in question.
</p>

<p>
<i>Emotional flooding therapists</i> are usually found among
psychologists, whose telephone directory listings will normally
indicate whether they offer one of these therapies.  The same
is true for psychologists with experience in <i>direct decision
therapy</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Biofeedback therapists</i> can be found in private practice; they
will also be found at pain and stress centers (which are often run
by hospitals on an outpatient basis).  These offer private or
publicly funded programs to help people with chronic pain or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
stress-related difficulties.  A number of counseling agencies have
begun to include biofeedback therapists on their staffs.
</p>

<p>
Biofeedback therapists in private practice, as well as pain and
stress centers, are listed in telephone directories.  Try looking
under "Biofeedback Therapy and Training" and under "Psychologists"
for those who indicate that they offer biofeedback.
</p>

<p>
<i>Relaxation training</i> (and sometimes also meditation) is
frequently offered by biofeedback therapists (as well as by many
psychologists and social workers).
</p>

<p>
Therapists who use <i>hypnosis</i> are often listed under "Hypnosis"
in telephone directories.  You will usually find a wide variety
of educational backgrounds represented among therapists in
these listings.  Some are in private practice; some work for
agencies.  You will probably see an array of credentials
advertised, perhaps ranging from therapists without degrees, to those
with Ph.D.s and M.D.s.  Here, especially, is an area in which to
exercise consumer caution.  Unfortunately, hypnotherapy is well
populated by therapists who lack professionally recognized
credentials.  It is wise to remember that Ph.D.s can be granted in
all sorts of fields&mdash;in education, theology, librarianship, etc.&mdash;as
well as psychology.  Some "therapists" practice with a Ph.D. after
their names, yet their Ph.D.s may be in fields totally unrelated to
counseling and psychotherapy.  Ph.D.s who are <i>licensed psychologists</i>
and who are members of the American Society of Clinical
Hypnosis offer professional credibility as hypnotherapists.  The
certification of therapists trained in hypnosis is still unsettled in
many states, where anyone can hang out a shingle.  Since many
licensed psychologists, psychiatrists, and some certified social
workers <i>do</i> receive professional training in hypnosis, these
are the professions to which it is most reliable to go for
hypnotherapy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Meditation techniques</i> may be learned on your own (see
Chapter 15), or you can seek out commercial or religious
organizations that teach meditation.  They are sometimes found
in the Yellow Pages under "Meditation Instruction."  Transcendental
Meditation (TM) programs have been popular and are
widespread.  Yoga instructors (raja yoga rather than hatha yoga)
also teach meditation.
</p>

<p>
Relatively few psychologists or social workers have actually
received training in the use of <i>therapeutic exercise</i>, since this
area is relatively new and its proponents are still small in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
number.  However, most psychologists and many social workers
are aware of the exercise programs advocated by Kostrubala and
Glasser (see Chapter 15) and can help you plan intelligently.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
ABOUT THE COST OF TREATMENT
</p>

<p>
Most health insurance plans offer at least partial coverage for
psychotherapy and counseling.  Consult your policy to find out
what providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers)
you may go to for covered treatment and for how long.  (If you
have special concerns about confidentiality in connection with
treatment under an insurance plan, see Chapter 19.)
</p>

<p>
As we noted earlier, it is possible to obtain treatment from
many psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and social work counselors
at reduced cost, if you have definite financial limitations
(see Chapter 4).
</p>

<p>
Many clinical psychologists and social workers indicate in
their directory listings in the Yellow Pages if fees are set on the
basis of a sliding scale-on the basis, that is, of ability to pay.  It
is worth a telephone call to find out.  Many public and some
private counseling agencies also set fees in this way.  Reduced
fees from psychiatrists are more likely through agencies that
offer psychiatric care than from psychiatrists in private practice.
For public agencies, look in the White Pages under the name of
your county; then look for the heading "Mental Health Services"
or "County Mental Health," or the equivalent.  You will
frequently find one or more mental health centers or clinics listed.
In the Yellow Pages, look under "Clinics" for a listing of private
and sometimes also public clinics.  It is usually clear from their
descriptions whether they offer psychotherapy or counseling or
only treatment for physical illness or injury.
</p>

<p>
Again, it may be worthwhile to mention that the costs of <i>group
therapy</i>, whether through a clinical psychologist or a social work
counselor, may be expected to be substantially less than the
costs of individual therapy.  (On the appropriateness of group
therapy, see Chapter 13.)
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
ONCE YOU HAVE LOCATED A THERAPIST
</p>

<p>
If you believe you have found a therapist whose background,
fees, and location meet your needs, I recommend that, when you
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
telephone for an appointment, you ask for an initial consultation.
This will make it clear, in the therapist's mind and your
own, that your appointment is for a trial session.  (The fee is
normally the same as for a regular appointment, but check on
this.)
</p>

<p>
When you go to this first session, it is very tempting to launch
into what is troubling you.  If you can hold yourself back in order
to ask a few preliminary questions about the therapist's
background, experience, approach, and a likely duration of
treatment&mdash;in other words, encourage the therapist to talk to you a
little bit about himself or herself&mdash;you will get a better idea of
the <i>person</i> behind the professional title.  This will help you
decide whether you want to continue with future sessions.
However, it may take several weeks, or even months, for you to
<i>know</i> that the relationship will in fact benefit you.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span></p>

<p class="t2b">
18
<br />
SHOULD YOU BE HOSPITALIZED?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There are two main reasons for psychiatric hospitalization:
</p>

<p>
1. <i>You would be better off away from home</i>.  Many things can
play a role here.  Perhaps there is too much family conflict at
home, too much emotional strain, for you to improve.  Or, your
family may simply not be calm enough to handle the crisis.  Or,
perhaps you have too many strong and upsetting associations at
home&mdash;e.g., if your spouse has just died or your daughter just
committed suicide at home.  Or, you may just have too little
privacy at home; you feel forced to maintain a stiff upper lip in
front of children, your spouse, or other family members, but you
simply can do this no longer.
</p>

<p>
2. <i>Your condition may be too serious to be treated appropriately
on an outpatient basis</i>.  If you are no longer in touch with
reality, are unable to communicate coherently, are hallucinating
or have delusions, you cannot be relied on to take care of
yourself.  If you are psychotic, your behavior may hurt others or
yourself.  If you are suffering from a major, incapacitating
depression, you may become suicidal.  Finally, if you are unable to
control an addiction to drugs or alcohol, inpatient care is more
likely to be effective.
</p>

<p>
You may, of course, have reasons to <i>resist</i> hospitalization.  Most
likely, your resistance will be based on fear&mdash;of the unknown, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
the later stigma of having been hospitalized for a psychiatric
condition, or of the <i>inner</i> stigma: that you must have been
terribly ill (or "weak") to justify hospitalization.  Furthermore, if
you have been hospitalized before, you may recall that the
hospital's supportive environment encouraged you to feel
dependent on it and to resist returning to normal living, and you
may fear falling prey to this again.
</p>

<p>
All of these are good reasons to proceed cautiously.  Only the
first fear can be reasoned with in an objective way, by
understanding what psychiatric hospitalization is really like,
something this chapter will help you to do.  Certainly, the other fears
also may have some basis.
</p>

<p>
Discrimination <i>does</i> still exist against former psychiatric
hospital patients.  They may find it difficult, for example, to enter
military service or serve in an important political capacity.
</p>

<p>
The inner stigma can be even more damaging, if you are a
highly self-blaming person.  If you are going to hold hospitalization
as yet another black mark against yourself, then you may
want to avoid hospitalization unless it means you are withholding
treatment from yourself that really is essential to your well-being.
</p>

<p>
If you have been hospitalized before for psychiatric care, the
last reason is very likely the most important one for you to weigh
carefully.  In the light of your past dependency needs, you must
decide whether the problems you now face are serious enough to
motivate you to walk into a situation that in the past you found
difficult to leave.
</p>

<p>
Most hospital admissions for psychiatric conditions today are
<i>voluntary</i>.  Usually, either your own judgment leads you to
accept hospitalization, or you are persuaded by family, friends,
family doctor, minister, or psychiatrist that doing so is in your
own best interest.  Involuntary hospitalization is legally difficult
and occurs primarily in cases in which, over a period of time,
there is evidence that a person's behavior is not responsible, that
he cannot take care of himself, or that he may injure himself or
others.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHAT HOSPITALIZATION IS LIKE
</p>

<p>
Several kinds of hospitalization are available to individuals
who are emotionally troubled:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* private or public hospitals in which there are special
floors or sections for psychiatric patients
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* hospitals that treat only psychiatric problems
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* inpatient programs that specialize in stress management or
the treatment of depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, and
other problems
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Typically, fifteen to twenty-five patients of both sexes will
reside in a hospital unit.  Often a ward is divided, with men living
on one side and women on the other.  In private and many public
hospitals, private and semiprivate rooms are available, depending
on your ability to pay or your insurance coverage.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, patients dress in everyday clothes rather than in
hospital gowns and pajamas.  There is usually a common dining
area where patients can eat at tables seating two to four people.
Day rooms are common&mdash;large areas with comfortable chairs
and couches, a television, stereo, books, and games.
</p>

<p>
If you were admitted to a hospital unit specializing in psychiatric
care, you would probably see a psychologist or psychiatrist
two or three times a week in individual sessions.  It is likely, since
your condition was serious enough to warrant hospitalization,
that you will receive medication during at least part of your stay
(see Chapter 16).
</p>

<p>
If you are a voluntary admission, you will be asked to sign
consent forms for treatment that is recommended to you.  You do
have a right to refuse treatment you do not want.
</p>

<p>
A complete physical examination is routinely required to rule
out underlying physical disorders.  You may also be asked to take
some written psychological tests, most being of the
multiple-choice variety.
</p>

<p>
Group sessions in hospitals are common.  In forming groups
attempts are made to choose people in ways that will be
mutually beneficial.  In part, these periods "in group" help to
offset feelings of being alone in a strange environment.
</p>

<p>
Activities are planned to combat monotony.  They may, for
example, include arts and crafts, sports, dancing, and day trips to
museums or the movies.
</p>

<p>
Staff members with whom you would have the most personal
contact are members of the psychiatric nursing staff.  Often,
when former patients are asked who helped them while in the
hospital, instead of mentioning the therapist, they name a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
member of the nursing staff.  Psychiatric nurses have received
special training in psychiatry and often are a major source of
human warmth and caring.
</p>

<p>
Depending on your progress, you may be encouraged to
return home during the day, or overnight, or for a weekend.  As it
becomes clear that you are improving, these periods may be
lengthened to see how you handle the transition from the
hospital, before being discharged.
</p>

<p>
Although hospitals expect patients to choose to remain until
they are discharged, few hospitals actively confine voluntary
psychiatric patients to prevent them from leaving early&mdash;and
then generally only in cases judged to be very serious.  The only
restrictions and rules you would likely encounter are those of
any hospital: to respect the rights of others, to be considerate, to
refrain from taking drugs unless they are prescribed, to smoke
only in smoking areas, and to maintain socially acceptable
behavior.
</p>

<p>
Inpatient hospital programs specializing in stress management,
depression, eating disorders, and so on, are normally
intended for one- to two-week stays.  Residential treatment
centers for problems requiring longer treatment&mdash;e.g., drug and
alcohol rehabilitation programs&mdash;are less formal than hospitals.
Often, residential treatment centers are located in the country
and may consist of a cluster of cottage-like buildings.  The
program is usually under the direction of a psychiatrist.
</p>

<p>
Hospital care and residential treatment are very expensive.
Most health insurance programs cover most of the costs of
inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, for several weeks or
months.  Public psychiatric hospitals must be relied on by many
people for longer stays, unless they bear the costs of private
hospital treatment themselves.  Physical conditions at state
psychiatric hospitals have in general improved in recent years but
still tend to fall short of private facilities, for lack of adequate
public funding.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
LEAVING
</p>

<p>
Probably the most difficult experience if you are hospitalized
for a psychiatric condition is leaving, not entering, the hospital.
There is frequently a sense of relief and comfort that comes once
you have made the decision to enter a hospital.  You have a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
"legitimate" reason for leaving your normal responsibilities; you
may feel "rescued" from family or work situations you could no
longer cope with.  Once you have begun to feel more at home in
the hospital setting, you begin to relax, to participate in
activities with less restraint or reluctance.  Then, as you improve,
thanks in great part to the concentrated attention and care you
are receiving, you realize that you must begin to think of
reentering life "outside."
</p>

<p>
Returning to your familiar life can be frightening.  It is usual to
wonder whether it will, perhaps again, prove to be too much of
a strain.  Leaving the hospital frequently means returning home
or going back to work, to shoulder the same burdens again,
trying to pick up where you left off.
</p>

<p>
Hospitalization is often a positive, reassuring experience.
Patients become aware that others do care and that, if life
becomes especially stressful, there <i>are</i> sources of professional
help and encouragement available to fall back on.  Most hospitals
encourage former patients to maintain contact through follow-up
services of some kind.  Leaving the hospital is made easier for
many people, for example, knowing that the psychologist or
psychiatrist is still there and that they will be seen on an
outpatient basis.  To help former hospital patients ease back into
more normal lives, groups that were formed in the hospital
sometimes will also continue to meet on an outpatient basis for
a time.
</p>

<p>
The decision to be hospitalized is difficult for anyone.  Hospital
care may help turn your life around and put you back on your
feet.  Or it can, if you are your own worst critic, give you another
burden to carry.  It is important to try not to block potentially
helpful treatment with excessive pride and to try to listen to
people who care about you.  If they are in favor of the decision,
their convictions should be considered.  If your doctor or
minister agrees, this adds weight to their advice.  Once you have
listened, try to make your decision your own, not anyone else's.

THE NEGATIVE LABEL OF EMOTIONAL ILLNESS
</p>

<p>
Society has attached an undeniable stigma to so-called emotional
or mental illness.  The public is afraid of conditions that are not
concrete and physical and are less easily understood.  Emotional
or mental difficulties seem more "hidden" and mysterious.  The
body is <i>tangible</i>, and we feel we have more control over it.
Setting a broken leg, having your appendix removed, even
open-heart surgery&mdash;they are not difficult for the public to grasp.
</p>

<p>
However, depression, anxiety, intolerance to stress, disorientation,
unsettling fears, unusual behavior&mdash;these are much less
readily understood by nonspecialists.  There is a tendency for
many people to judge rather harshly what they do not comprehend.
When many individuals who are ignorant of psychology
hear of someone in emotional distress, the inclination is often to
condemn.  Condemnation is frequently an expression of fear&mdash;fear
of what is not understood.
</p>

<p>
During the last two to three decades, society has gradually
become more psychologically aware and more intelligent about
nonphysical problems.  And yet, the stigma of emotional or
mental illness has still not been erased.  It will take time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
</p>

<p>
As a result, many people who are in serious emotional distress
hesitate to go to a therapist.  They are afraid of the negative label
that others may apply to them, if information about them ever
"got out."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes this is a justifiable worry.  Some employers are
bigoted and may discriminate against employees with known
emotional problems (even though this is blatantly illegal).  And
some families, in which there is little psychological understanding
and much fear, may withdraw from a family member who lets
it be known that he or she is in emotional distress.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, most people like to feel that they have a
certain degree of compassion and openness&mdash;even those who
are judgmental!  If you are willing to face ignorant attitudes
head-on, unflinchingly (and this can take a great deal of courage), you
will frequently gain the respect of others through your honesty.
They will perceive your unwillingness to judge yourself negatively
and may even come to admire the strength and determination
you have to improve your life.
</p>

<p>
If you are in emotional distress, you may have to face a
dilemma: whether it is <i>prudent</i> to try to conceal your difficulties
from people because you believe that some of them may judge
you harshly and critically if they find out you are in therapy, or
whether it is likely that they would understand, and perhaps
even sympathize, if you were able to be open and had the
courage and self-confidence to help educate others on a psychological
level.  Unfortunately, people in real emotional distress
don't have the energy, the courage, or the self-confidence to fight
social battles!  It therefore usually seems to be a great deal easier
to try to keep your own affairs <i>private</i>.  But this is not always
simple to do.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
Confidentiality as it relates to counseling and psychotherapy is
not a straightforward thing; much that has to do with confidentiality
is still an unsettled and still debated issue.  In reality, there are
as yet few laws that
fully and genuinely protect personal privacy.
</p>

<p>
There are two central questions relating to confidentiality
that I want to raise here.  The first is a question only you can
answer.  I will try to discuss some of the answers to the second.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
HOW IMPORTANT IS CONFIDENTIALITY TO YOU?
</p>

<p>
Only you can answer this.  It may be reassuring to know that,
usually, the safeguards observed by therapists are sufficient to
protect the personal affairs of clients.  And it is unusual for any real
or lasting harm come to a client if information about him or her
is released.
</p>

<p>
Many individuals, when they are trapped in a prison of
self-concern and self-involvement, are prone to exaggerate or
magnify the ultimate significance of being "discovered" in therapy,
believing that a release of information about them will be
potentially explosive and damaging.  Individuals who are
emotionally very upset are inclined to focus on threatening aspects
of therapy.
</p>

<p>
We have already looked at some of the ways that a heightened
sensitivity to maintain secrecy about your problems can lead to
self-imprisonment, to blocks that stand in the way of positive
change (see Chapter 1).  Most of the information you may want
kept secret may not really be as damaging as you first were inclined
to think.  Much depends on how <i>you</i> respond to information that
might be released about you.  Let's look at an example.
</p>

<p>
A little more than a year ago, George Malcolm became seriously
depressed.  He was forced to resign from his job, and then
he received disability income for ten months.  During this time
he entered therapy.  His experience helped him to understand a
number of important things about himself that he had ignored in
the past.  He discovered that he had felt very unsatisfied in his
previous job; he had buried his frustrations and had suppressed
the anger he felt at being trapped in a situation he disliked.  It was
a situation he felt he had no control over because of his concern
for his and his family's financial security.  He was also worried
about his mother, who would probably have to be admitted to a
nursing home in the near future.  Her situation was an added
reason for George's financial worry.
</p>

<p>
He also came to realize that his marriage was suffering because
of his insistence that his wife not work.  She, on the other hand,
felt overcontrolled by her husband: she felt that he stood in the
way of her personal growth.
</p>

<p>
As a result of his increased awareness, George came to see that
losing his former job was really a blessing in disguise.  His
marriage began to improve when George's depression for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
first time put him in a <i>dependent</i> position; he needed his wife's
emotional support, and she, in turn, began to see him as a
<i>person</i>, with weaknesses of his own, and not as she had idealized
him.
</p>

<p>
George's depression allowed him to understand and appreciate
his wife's previously frustrated sense of initiative.  He now
encouraged her to do what she had long wanted to do, to
develop a career.
</p>

<p>
Because George received disability during his depression, his
insurance company had information about him on file.  When
George was interviewed for a new job a year after he became
depressed, he was asked at the interview if he had been ill during
the preceding year, when he had not worked.
</p>

<p>
George decided to be truthful and said that he had become
depressed and that as a result of the experience had learned
much about himself.  In particular, he had learned what kind of
work really interested him and gave him a sense of satisfaction.
Although it had been a difficult period, George said that he felt
he had gained a great deal from the experience.
</p>

<p>
George's prospective employer was impressed by George's
honesty and evident sincerity.  George got the job&mdash;in large part
because of the attitude he took toward his depression.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
WHAT LAWS PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY?
</p>

<p>
To what extent is your privacy protected?  What situations
legally justify your therapist to release information about you?[<a id="chap19fn1text"></a><a href="#chap19fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap19fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap19fn1text">1</a>] Since the first edition of this book, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was passed in 1996,
bringing with it a mass of complexities relating to patient privacy.
There remain many still unsettled legal questions and issues
relating to the so-called Privacy Rule, which there is not space
here to discuss. If you wish to know more about the legal status
and interpretation of patient privacy, see Wikipedia's article
about HIPAA at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIPAA.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These questions do not always have clear-cut answers.  There
may or may not be special laws in your state to protect the confidentiality
of psychotherapy.  The legal status of therapy is still ambiguous
in many states.  Even in those where laws have been passed,
legal protection is sometimes not reliable unless your therapist is willing to
face a jail sentence if need be to maintain the confidence you
have entrusted in him.  If you feel a situation is likely to arise that
would put legal pressure on your therapist to release information
about you (for example, in a child-custody hearing), you
should ask your therapist what his or her commitments to confidentiality
are.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
"<i>Leaks</i>"
</p>

<p>
More frequently, confidentiality is broken due to informality
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
rather than due to an intentional release of information.  For
example, if you are referred to another therapist or to a physician,
the chances are that information about you will be shared
by your original therapist with the new therapist or doctor.  You
can ask your therapist <i>not</i> to release information in this way, but
if you do, the care you receive as a result of the referral cannot
benefit from your first therapist's understanding of you.  On the
other hand, if you do permit your file to be shared with a new
therapist or doctor, you will probably not know in advance
know what his or her own policies about confidentiality are.
</p>

<p>
There is a second way that information about you may be
released.  Often, therapists discuss information about their
clients with colleagues in an effort to provide better help for
them.  It is often to your definite advantage to have other
therapists share their assessments and ideas with your therapist.
But if you ask your therapist to refrain from discussing your case
with professional colleagues, he or she will very likely agree to
cooperate with you.
</p>

<p>
If you believe you have special reasons to be concerned about
protecting the confidentiality of your relationship with your
therapist, it will help him or her to know this, and it may be
possible to request that special
precautions be taken to protect your file from access by
others.
</p>

<p>
Accidental or inadvertent breaks of confidentiality sometimes
can also occur.  For example, billings may be mailed to your
address and then be opened by a spouse, child, or parent whom
you may not have wanted told that you were in therapy.
</p>

<p>
Here is another example: If you enter group therapy, other
members of the group are not professionally bound by rules
governing confidentiality.  Because they are not counseling
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
professionals themselves, they will be less attentive to matters
involving confidentiality&mdash;although most group therapists try,
when a group is first formed, to get group members to agree not
to disclose privileged information outside of sessions.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Exceptions</i>
</p>

<p>
Beyond the kinds of possible breaks of confidentiality that
are due to inattention, informality, and access of information
about you by others, there are a number of legal exceptions to
confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
Examination by court order is one.  If a judge orders you to be
examined by a psychiatrist or psychologist, his findings will be
transmitted to the court and so be made public.
</p>

<p>
If a client reveals his or her intention and decision to commit a
crime, a therapist is legally required to report this to authorities.
If a patient plans to commit homicide, therapists are required by
law to take whatever action is necessary to prevent the murder.
In California, in addition to warning the police of the homicidal
intentions of a client, therapists must also take steps to warn the
intended victim, if this is possible.
</p>

<p>
If a patient is seriously suicidal&mdash;that is, has decided on a
means to commit suicide, has decided when to do this, and cannot be
persuaded to hold off while in therapy&mdash;the therapist is legally
bound to take whatever action may be necessary to prevent the
patient's suicide, including the disclosure of pertinent information
to public officials.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, in cases of child abuse or neglect, the law requires
that a client's confidential relationship with his or her therapist be set
to one side in order to provide adequate protection and care for
the child.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  THREATS TO PRIVACY FROM<br />
  HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES<br />
</p>

<p>
There is another way that privacy can be invaded, and for
many people it is little known and more significant than the
breaks of confidentiality we have already discussed.  It comes
about as a result of recently formed <i>data banks</i> that are
maintained and continuously updated by insurance companies.
Information about insurance claims and payments not only are
kept on file by individual insurance companies, but a number of
national data banks have been established to provide insurance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
companies with information about the health histories of
individuals.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you file a health insurance application or a
claim for benefits with many insurance companies, they often
will run a check on your health history through a national
computerized clearinghouse that maintains insurance information.
This information includes data about previous insurance
claims you may have made.  Insurance companies believe that
they have a right to data of this kind, since the information
protects them from having to pay for health care costs that come
about due to "preexisting conditions," which many insurance
policies limit or exclude.  Too, if you have suffered from poor
health in the past, and were covered by insurance, there are
probably data about your health history on file in such a national
computerized clearinghouse; by accessing information about
you, an insurance company is able to form a judgment as to
whether you are an excessive risk.
</p>

<p>
Like any information about you that has been compiled and is
furnished without your consent, these data about your health
history&mdash;maintained by agencies that service insurance
companies&mdash;are subject to possible abuse.  Information on file can and
is used to protect the interests of subscribing insurance companies;
your own interests may not be served in the process.  Not
only might you be denied future insurance benefits, but the
information maintained about you is subject to whatever use the
insurance clearinghouse believes is appropriate.
</p>

<p>
As yet, laws to secure a true measure of personal privacy have
not been passed.  This has been one of the goals of organizations
like the American Civil Liberties Union.
</p>

<p>
There is a second insurance-related issue that has to do with
confidentiality.  If you have group health insurance through your
employer, it will be necessary for your therapist to complete
reports about you in order for you to receive benefits under your
insurance plan.  (I am assuming here that your insurance offers
coverage for counseling, psychotherapy, or psychiatry.)  The
reports filed by your therapist with the group health insurance
company are sometimes filed <i>through your employer</i>, and
sometimes employers require their group health companies to
provide <i>them</i> with information about health care supplied to their
employees.  In either way, the fact that you are in therapy and the
general reasons for your need for therapy may come to the
attention of your employer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
</p>

<p>
If your employer is a large company or organization, such
information will probably be filed in your employer's business or
insurance office and laid to rest; it will probably not come to the
attention of individuals you actually deal with in your work.  But
it may.  In a smaller company, there is a greater risk.
</p>

<p>
If you are really concerned about this possibility, ask your
insurance officer how health claims are handled and whether
health information is requested by your employer from the
insurance company.
</p>

<p>
If you are then still concerned and feel that you need to avoid
potential complications at work, you may prefer to see a
therapist on your own <i>and refrain from using your employer's
insurance coverage</i>.  If you see a therapist in private practice,
your decision to pay your own bill may be expensive for you.  If
finances are a problem, bear in mind that you can frequently
locate competent help through county, state, or private
counseling agencies.  If you go to an agency, remember that you will
almost certainly be asked whether you have insurance coverage.
If you admit that you do, you will have defeated your purpose in
going to an agency on your own to protect your privacy.  It is,
after all, your right to obtain treatment that <i>you</i> elect to pay for.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
MAGNIFYING YOUR NEED FOR SECRECY
</p>

<p>
After reviewing these ways in which confidentiality may be
broken&mdash;by accident or sometimes excessive informality, by
legal requirements, or by what to many of us constitutes an
invasion of personal privacy by insurance companies&mdash;you may
wonder to what extent information that you disclose in therapy
really <i>is</i> protected.
</p>

<p>
In fact, very seldom are the <i>details</i> of therapy
divulged to others without a client's advance consent.  Most of us
do not need to be worried by legal exceptions to confidentiality:
most of us are not actually homicidal (though we may feel very
angry at times!); most of us are not determined to take our lives
(though we may at times feel very disheartened); most of us are
not concerned that a court will order us to be examined by a
psychiatrist.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to give a realistic picture of confidentiality in
therapy.  The fact that you receive mental health counseling
or therapy may inadvertently be disclosed by such things as a billing
that goes astray or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
by a fellow group member's inclination to talk too
much outside of the group.  If you decide to make use of
insurance coverage, there are possible consequences you ought
to be aware of.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to underline the fact that most people who enter
therapy blow out of proportion the real significance of these
possible, but comparatively infrequent, "leaks."
</p>

<p>
Karl A. Menninger, a renowned and original contributor to
psychiatry, quotes one of his patients who shared her intelligent
reflections with him:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"When I look back upon the many months I pondered as to
how I might get here without anyone knowing, and the devious
routes I considered and actually took to accomplish this, only
to realize that some of the symptoms from which I suffer are
respectable enough to be acknowledged anywhere and valid
enough to explain my coming here, it all seems so utterly
ridiculous.  I looked furtively out of the corner of my eye at the
people I met here, expecting them to betray their shame or
their queerness, only to discover that I often could not
distinguish the patients from the physicians, or from other
visitors.  I suppose it is such a commonplace experience to you
that you cannot realize how startling that is to a naive layman,
like myself, even one who thinks he has read a little and laid
aside some of the provincialism and prejudice which to some
extent blind us all.  I see how there is something emotional in
it; if the patient feels only depressed or guilty or confused, then
one looks upon his consulting the psychiatrist as a disgraceful
recourse; but if some of the symptoms take form in one of the
bodily organs, all the shame vanishes.  There is no sense to it,
but that's how it is.  I have written a dozen letters to tell people
where I am, the very people from whom in the past six months
I have tried to conceal my need of this."[<a id="chap19fn2text"></a><a href="#chap19fn2">2</a>]

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
DON'T LET EXAGGERATED WORRIES HOLD YOU BACK
</p>

<p>
When you stop for a moment to consider how widespread
personal problems are&mdash;20 percent of Americans have serious
emotional difficulties&mdash;isn't there something silly, ridiculous,
and, frequently, self-defeating in being overly concerned about
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
keeping others from knowing that, for a time, you were depressed,
anxious, unsatisfied, and frustrated to the point that you
<i>decided</i> to do something about these unhappy feelings?
</p>

<p>
To be sure, discretion is sometimes prudent.  An employer,
your family, or some of your friends may be so provincial or
bigoted as to think that counseling is close to a misdemeanor.
Ignorant or uninformed people do tend to judge hastily and to
condemn.  But often, if you do have the endurance, many of them
are also willing to change their minds when they have the
opportunity to understand a little bit about what they fear.
</p>

<p>
You cannot live for the approval of others.  If you believe
therapy may help you improve your life, don't allow yourself to
be held back by exaggerated worries.
</p>

<p>
It usually <i>is</i> possible to keep confidential the fact that you have
entered therapy when there are especially compelling reasons to
exercise foresight and caution.  <i>Explain</i> your concerns to your
therapist; he or she can then make every effort to help you.

<br />
DOES THERAPY WORK?
</p>

<p>
Whether or not therapy works is a question that has hounded
psychotherapists for more than thirty years, when evaluative
studies began to cast doubts on its effectiveness.  Since then,
several hundred studies of the effectiveness of psychotherapy
have been made.  Some of them appear to show that psychotherapy
is highly successful, and many have pointed to evidence that
psychotherapy is no more effective than no treatment at all.
</p>

<p>
The ambiguity about this issue has been very troublesome to
therapists and tends not to be openly discussed with clients, for
obvious reasons.
</p>

<p>
Why reports about psychotherapy's effectiveness have been so
contradictory and ambiguous has never been made clear.  But
understanding the reasons behind these opposing claims will
give us a basis for optimism.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CLAIMS AGAINST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p>

<p>
If people who are emotionally troubled "get well" through
psychotherapy in about the same length of time as those who are
not given any treatment at all, we would be inclined to say that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
psychotherapy didn't help.  Several studies have shown that the
majority of people with "neurotic disorders" improve spontaneously,
on the average, in one to two years.[<a id="chap20fn1text"></a><a href="#chap20fn1">1</a>]  When people with
similar problems <i>are</i> treated with psychotherapy, the outcome is
virtually the same: the spontaneous remission rate for all practical
purposes is the same as the rate of success due to therapy.
Psychotherapy doesn't seem to make a difference.  We'll call this
the <i>spontaneous remission criticism</i> and will come back to it in
a moment.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap20fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap20fn1text">1</a>] S. Rachman, <i>The Effects of Psychotherapy</i>
(New York: Pergamon Press, 1971) p. 18.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Most studies of the effectiveness of psychotherapy make use of
"placebo treatments": a group of emotionally troubled individuals
is treated with one of the major approaches to psychotherapy
by well-trained therapists, and another group of similarly
troubled people is treated by untrained "therapists" who offer
their clients a "therapy" that is simply <i>made up</i> but is carefully
presented so as to be believable.  And, again, it turns out that
clients treated with the legitimate therapy improve, but not
significantly more than those in the placebo group.  We'll call this
the <i>placebo criticism</i> and will come back to it, too, in a moment.
</p>

<p>
A few studies have shown that psychotherapy can actually be
<i>injurious</i> to clients.  A disorder <i>brought about</i> by medical
treatment is called an <i>iatrogenic disturbance</i>.  <i>Iatrogenesis</i> is the
Greek word for "brought about by doctors."  If the iatrogenesis
criticism is valid, then therapy may be not only ineffective but
sometimes actually <i>harmful</i>.[<a id="chap20fn2text"></a><a href="#chap20fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap20fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap20fn2text">2</a>] See, for example, Thomas J. Nardi, "Psychotherapy: Cui Bono?,"
in Jusuf Hariman, ed.,
<i>Does Psychotherapy Really Help People?</i>  (Springfield, IL:
Charles C. Thomas, 1984), pp. 154-164.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Together, these three criticisms have made therapists feel very
defensive&mdash;and rightly so.  If fictitious treatment by a mock
therapist works as well as treatment provided by a man or
woman who has trained long and hard for a Ph.D. or M.D.,
wouldn't <i>you</i> feel ill at ease&mdash;perhaps very much ill at
ease!&mdash;charging your clients $75 to $100 an hour for your time for a
service that is no better than none at all and may even cause your
clients to get worse?
</p>

<p>
These are not trumped-up charges against psychotherapy that
we can afford to ignore.  Therapists don't like to confront them.

I have always felt that it is completely unethical to subject
neurotic patients to a treatment the efficacy of which has not
been proven, and indeed, the efficacy of which is very much in
doubt&mdash;so much so that there is no good evidence for it, in
spite of hundreds of studies devoted to the question.  Patients
are asked to spend money and time they can ill afford, and
subject themselves to a gruelling experience, to no good
purpose at all; this surely cannot be right.  At least there should
be a statutory warning to the effect that the treatment they are
proposing to enter has never been shown to be effective, is
very lengthy and costly, and may indeed do harm to the

WHY PESSIMISM IS UNFOUNDED
</p>

<p class="quote2">
I hold all contemporary psychiatric approaches&mdash;all "mental-health"
methods&mdash;as basically flawed because they all search
for solutions along medical-technical lines.  But solutions for
what?  For life!  But life is not a problem to be solved.  Life is
something to be lived, as intelligently, as competently, as well
as we can, day in and day out.  Life is something we must
endure.  There is no solution for it.[<a id="chap20fn11text"></a><a href="#chap20fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap20fn11"></a>
[<a href="#chap20fn11text">11</a>] Thomas Szasz, interviewed in Jonathan Miller, <i>States of Mind</i>
(New York: Pantheon Books, 1983), p. 290.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We must grab the bull by the horns.  Thousands upon thousands
of people continue to enter psychotherapy.  How long
would any service last if it failed to serve the needs of its market?
It is tempting to suppose that something constructive, at least
sometimes, happens as a result of psychotherapy to justify the
time, expense, and faith of clients.  Or is their faith really
misplaced?
</p>

<p>
One of the most outspoken critics of psychotherapy is
psychiatrist Thomas Szasz.  His views are an unlikely source for a
defense of psychotherapy, but its defense, oddly enough, can be
found there.
</p>

<p>
Szasz argues that psychology has been influenced by the
disease model that dominates medicine.  Medicine bases its
conception of treatment on the fact that there are diseases (or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
injuries) that can be helped by means of drugs or surgery.
Illnesses and injuries are <i>treatable conditions</i>.  Treatment is
applied from outside by the physician, and the condition, when
the treatment is effective, improves.
</p>

<p>
But psychiatry goes a step too far when it claims that people
who become emotionally helpless, hopeless, lonely, or agitated
are actually <i>sick</i>.  Szasz claims that they are not sick; they are
helpless, hopeless, lonely, or agitated.  These are not "illnesses"
but, rather, some of the tragic conditions of life.  They are
<i>problems of living</i>.  For Szasz&mdash;and for therapists like Viktor
Frankl and Alfred Adler&mdash;psychological problems resemble
"moral problems" much more than they do "physical diseases."  They
involve discouragement, loss of morale, loss of moral
courage.  They are <i>states of demoralization</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now, demoralization is not a <i>treatable condition</i>&mdash;not,
certainly, in the medical sense.  You cannot apply treatment from
without and expect that the patient will get better.  The situation
is much more complex than this.  The patient&mdash;let's shift at this
point to calling him or her the <i>client</i>&mdash;is much more actively
involved in the process of psychotherapy than is a <i>patient</i> in
medicine.  A woman who contracts pneumonia can be cured with
antibiotics while she lies in bed watching television or sleeping.
But an emotionally troubled woman&mdash;who has had a succession
of unhappy marriages, who has lost job after job, whose personality
is offensive to others, who has a low sense of self-worth, and
who has lost a sense of meaning and direction in life&mdash;cannot be
cured while she lies in bed and is treated with appropriate
medication.  "Effective treatment" just isn't possible; too much is
up to the client herself.
</p>

<p>
Basically, this is why studies of the effectiveness of psychotherapy
have generally led to discouraging results.  Most psychological
conditions (there are exceptions, as we will see) are not, at
least at present, <i>treatable in the medical sense</i>.  To combat them
requires of the client a great deal of his or her own effort and
even exertion.  They require self-discipline, moral courage, faith
in oneself&mdash;all the things emotional distress tends to undermine.
No approach to psychotherapy can itself be medically effective in
treating conditions like these.  Somehow, the client must reach a
point where he can lift himself by the bootstraps.  He can be
<i>encouraged</i> by the therapist, he can be <i>reasoned with</i>, he can be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
<i>manipulated in strategic therapeutic ways</i>, the therapist can
exhort him to be rational, but the focus always comes back to the
client.  Is he or she motivated to learn how to change?  Is he or she
an "effective learner"&mdash;that is, a "good student"?
</p>

<p>
The hundreds of attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of
approaches to psychotherapy have, incredibly, left out this
essential reference to the clients themselves: What kind of
people are they?  What encourages <i>them</i>?  What can act as a
source for their motivation, for the strength they have lost?
</p>

<p>
Ironically, the answer to these questions also lies unwittingly
in the hands of psychotherapy's harshest critics.
</p>

<p>
The worst blow to fall on the shoulders of psychotherapists
was dealt by placebo studies.  Experiments were designed that
would <i>convince</i> a group of emotionally troubled clients that
taking a pink pill (in reality, a sugar-filled placebo) would
reduce their symptoms.  In fact, their symptoms were, in general,
reduced, and often by as much as treatment in formal psychotherapy.
This fact has been interpreted by most therapists to
mean that psychotherapy must therefore have been ineffective.  If
a pink and useless pill could equal the effects of therapy, then
therapy was equally useless.
</p>

<p>
But this involved a huge oversight and a mistake in logic.  The
therapy <i>did</i> work, <i>as did</i> the placebo.  But why?
</p>

<p>
The placebo effect has become increasingly interesting to
psychological as well as medical researchers.  Apparently, a
client's or patient's strong <i>belief</i> in the therapeutic value of a
process sometimes has a measurable influence on his future
health.  The way belief can act in this way is not necessarily
mysterious or mystical.  If we are prepared to see emotional
difficulties in terms of demoralization, then belief in therapeutic
effectiveness is the most clear-cut counterbalancing force.
Strong belief of this kind may be enough&mdash;<i>if</i> the client really
wishes to change and <i>if</i> the therapist and the approach to
therapy together can inspire the client's confidence in his own
ability to regain control of his life&mdash;to help the client begin to
lift himself by the bootstraps.  Just what the necessary ingredients
are to make this possible is not yet definitely known.  Some
approaches to therapy, however, seem to be more successful
than others in inspiring confidence in clients with certain
personality traits and with certain goals or problems.  The best
evidence for this comes from clients themselves, whose evaluations
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
of their own experiences in therapy we will look at in a
moment.
</p>

<p>
The second blow that fell on psychotherapy came from the
spontaneous remission critics.  Again, studies demonstrated
certain facts:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* How long it takes for spontaneous remission to occur
depends greatly on what sorts of emotional difficulties
clients have.  People with depressive or anxiety reactions
tend, for example, to have spontaneous remissions faster
than persons with obsessive-compulsive or
hypochondriacal symptoms.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* The percentages of clients who do experience
spontaneous remissions are related to the period of time a
study uses as a basis.  (The follow-up periods of different
studies vary a great deal, from months to many years.  As
one researcher commented, "It is doubtful whether life
can guarantee five years of stability to any person."[<a id="chap20fn12text"></a><a href="#chap20fn12">12</a>])
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap20fn12"></a>
[<a href="#chap20fn12text">12</a>] Eisenbud, quoted in H. H. Mosak, "Problems in the
Definition and Measurement of Success in Psychotherapy,"
in Werner Wolff and Joseph A. Precker, eds.,
<i>Success in Psychotherapy</i> (New York: Grime &amp; Stratton, 1952), p. 13.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="bullet">
* Spontaneous remissions frequently happen to clients
whose lives improve because of fortunate events, such as
an improved position at work, successful marriages and
personal relationships, and periods during which pressing
problems become fewer and life more stable.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Given these facts, spontaneous remission critics argued that,
since many troubled individuals will get better anyway, <i>without
psychotherapy</i>, we cannot know that psychotherapy caused any
beneficial effects.
</p>

<p>
Again, poor logic.  It is like saying that since certain bone
fractures will eventually heal themselves in correct alignment,
without being set in a cast, we cannot know for these cases that
a cast had any beneficial effects.  Well, for many people, a suitable
psychotherapy serves much the same function as a cast does for
a broken bone: it supports, lessens vulnerability, reduces pain,
and makes life a little more comfortable until natural healing can
take place.  Again, whom do we ask to determine whether this is
the case?  We must ask the person with the fractured arm whether
the cast made him or her more comfortable.

HOW PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE INJURIOUS TO YOUR HEALTH
</p>

<p class="quote">
Is there substantial evidence that psychotherapists sometimes
harm, as well as benefit, their clients?  I think that there
definitely is and that this has been fairly well demonstrated.[<a id="chap20fn13text"></a><a href="#chap20fn13">13</a>]

as They Now Are?," in J. Hariman, ed.,
<i>Does Psychotherapy Really Help People?</i>, p. 240.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Even love can harm, and psychotherapy is no exception.  Ellis
identifies some of the main ways psychotherapists can make
clients worse:[<a id="chap20fn14text"></a><a href="#chap20fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap20fn14"></a>
[<a href="#chap20fn14text">14</a>] <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 24-36.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists may encourage clients to be dependent on
them.  Directly or indirectly a therapist can convey to a
client, "You cannot get along without me," "You will
probably need to spend at least two more years in
therapy," etc.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists may overemphasize the significance of the
client's past experience to the point that they persuade the
client to feel unjustifiably weighed down and controlled by
past events and circumstances.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists may become so hooked on the importance of
modeling positive personal qualities (warmth, positive
regard, congruence, empathy) for a client that they will
not provide any active-directive leadership during a time
when the client is floundering and needs strong
recommendations.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists may place too much importance on the role of
insight.  The search for insight can be never-ending.  It is
useful only to some clients; for others, insight is irrelevant
to helping them change.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Many therapists feel that therapy gives clients a chance to
vent their feelings.  But catharsis by itself is not enough to
replace destructive patterns of behavior and thinking with
constructive ones.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists may rely excessively on distracting the client
from issues that trouble him; e.g., relaxation training,
meditation, or therapeutic exercise can help clients break
out of a cycle of self-preoccupation.  Self-absorption
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
perpetuates emotional suffering; distractions can therefore
be invaluable.  But if a client's underlying self-defeating
attitudes are not confronted, distraction alone will not be
enough to bring about lasting change.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Therapists may rely too heavily on getting clients to "think
positively."  Positive thinking can undermine a client's
already shaky confidence if he fails to achieve the goals
that positive thinking led him to expect.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These are undeniable shortcomings of therapy.  They can
reduce the effectiveness of therapy, or negate its constructive
effects, or even cause clients to accept the therapist's belief that
their condition is worse than they thought and so persuade them
to feel, and to be, even more troubled.
</p>

<p>
It is important to be aware of these signs of what Ellis rightly
calls incompetence in therapists.  It is also important to realize
that psychotherapy is not unique in having to deal with professional
incompetence.  Physicians can and do fall victim to many
of the same excesses: needlessly alarming patients, misdiagnosing
their conditions, and sometimes treating them in ways that
lead to a general worsening of their health.  Iatrogenesis exists in
medicine as well as in psychotherapy.
</p>

<p>
Until the day when the world is a perfect place, we simply have
to take <i>caveat emptor</i> to heart&mdash;let the buyer beware.  A Ph.D. in
clinical psychology, certification in marriage and family counseling,
or an M.D. with specialization in psychiatry unfortunately
does not guarantee against human fallibility and lack of wisdom.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WHEN PSYCHOTHERAPY IS SUCCESSFUL
</p>

<p>
It might be argued, then, that the worth of psychotherapy to
the consumer (the client) does not depend on its being
superior to a placebo.  Whether it is or is not superior is a
theoretical question of interest to theoreticians; in judging the
practical worth of psychotherapy, what matters is consumer
satisfaction.  Judged by the latter criterion, psychotherapy is
indeed worthwhile.[<a id="chap20fn15text"></a><a href="#chap20fn15">15</a>]
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
</p>

<p>
There is a world of difference between popularity and effectiveness.
Is psychotherapy only popular and simply ineffective?
</p>

<p>
All approaches to therapy have a built-in expectation that
positive change will result.  This belief implicitly is communicated
to clients, and it can provide them with a sense of hope
that replaces the helpless and demoralized state that has
motivated them to seek therapy.
</p>

<p>
This happens in several ways.  For example, paying attention to
a person increases his morale and self-esteem.  This is called the
<i>Hawthorne effect</i>.  "Anyone who has been in therapy can
appreciate the gratification that comes from having a competent
professional give undivided attention for an hour."[<a id="chap20fn16text"></a><a href="#chap20fn16">16</a>]  Also, the
expectation on the part of a therapist that positive results will
follow itself can influence a client's attitudes and his belief that
he will get better, that emotional suffering will lessen and end.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

Analysis</i> (Homewood, IL: The Dorsey Press, 1979), p. 5.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The strength of a client's <i>belief</i> that he <i>can</i> change, that he <i>can</i>
improve, is the major single force in psychotherapy.  The client
has to feel that his belief is <i>warranted</i>.  Many factors play a role
here: the client's education level and the respect he may feel
toward the therapist's training and experience; the intangibles of
therapy&mdash;the therapist's integrity, authenticity or convincingness,
the client's sense that he is understood, that the therapist
cares, that the therapist himself has learned how to cope with
living and can communicate this, etc.  Psychotherapy can be
successful when this sense of <i>promise</i> is present in therapy
sessions.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If most emotional difficulties are not illnesses at all but
problems of living, and if problems of living cannot be treated
medically, then the hundreds of evaluative studies of therapeutic
effectiveness have been looking for something that simply is not
there: an objective standard against which to judge therapeutic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P277"></a>277}</span>
success.  It makes very little sense to speak of standards in
connection with problems of living that come about from
demoralization.  The only standard we can reasonably appeal to is
the subjective judgment of clients themselves, who have
experienced periods in therapy.

<p class="quote2">

WHAT MAKES PSYCHOTHERAPY SUCCESSFUL
</p>

<p class="t3b">
  <i>It is not so much the teacher who teaches but<br />
  the student who learns.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p class="quote2">
Whether or not the client gets value for fee paid to a
psychotherapist depends largely on the client.

<p>
Psychotherapy is much more like education than it is like
medicine.  In education, certain students&mdash;no more or less
intelligent than others&mdash;will nevertheless be more successful.  They
have well-known characteristics: they are interested in what the
experience of education can offer them, and they work hard and
regularly.
</p>

<p>
Very much the same thing holds true in psychotherapy: some
clients simply get more from therapy than others.  Why?  In part it
has to do with how well matched a client and the approach of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P280"></a>280}</span>
therapist are.  In part it is the amount of confidence the client
comes to feel toward the therapist as a person.  Beyond these, the
qualities of a successful client are very similar to those of a
successful student.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, clients who have successful experiences in
therapy tend to share these characteristics:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* While in therapy, they are motivated to change: They feel
considerable internal pressure to do something to resolve
their problems.  They come to feel a sense of initiative and
determination.  They come to believe in the process of
therapy and feel it can be of help to them.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They are self-disciplined.  They keep appointments
regularly, they attempt to implement the therapist's
recommendations, and they are less incapacitated by their
difficulties than other clients with similar problems.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* They have a level of emotional maturity that is high
enough to withstand some of the painful feelings or
frustrations they encounter in therapy.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Frequently they come to <i>enjoy</i> therapy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Obviously, a great deal does depend on the therapist.  And yet,
while a good student can learn much in spite of a poor teacher,
a poor student learns little from an excellent teacher.  Successful
therapy depends primarily on the client.
</p>

<p>
Other factors can affect your ability to succeed in therapy, but
these are factors over which you have no control:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* whether you have the emotional support and sympathy of
an understanding and tolerant spouse or family
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* whether you have had a long history of emotional
problems in connection with work and interpersonal
relations (deeply ingrained habits are harder to break)
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* whether precipitating factors brought about your present
difficulties or they just appeared "out of the blue"
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* how long you have had your present problem

<p>
What the future holds in store for you after therapy relies
greatly on many of these same factors and on many of the
personality qualities that helped you, or hindered you, as a client
in therapy (see Chapter 21).
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
SO, DOES PSYCHOTHERAPY WORK?
</p>

<p>
Yes, for certain clients and under certain circumstances.  The
main changes that psychotherapies aim for are either to
eliminate destructive habits of thought, attitude, or behavior or to
establish new, constructive habits.  Neither one can be
accomplished by means of a medically effective treatment that is
applied to the patient until a cure occurs.
</p>

<p>
A few emotional problems fall under the heading of true psychiatric
disorders and result from physical causes.  They include, for
example, epilepsy, drug addiction, and Alzheimer's disease.  But
these conditions are in the minority; most emotional "disorders"
have not been traced to underlying organic causes.  There are
several currently competing hypotheses relating to possible
biochemical bases of schizophrenia, mania, depression, and
anxiety disorders.  As time goes by and medical research
progresses, more emotional conditions will very likely be tied to
underlying physical problems.
</p>

<p>
Until that time, however, they remain <i>medically</i> incurable
conditions.  At present, the possibility of overcoming them
depends heavily on clients themselves, their ability to find an
approach to therapy that is appropriate for their personality and
their goals or problems, and their good fortune in locating a
therapist who is able to help them to summon the faith, energy,
determination, and courage necessary to overcome their sense
of demoralization.

<br />
LIFE AFTER THERAPY
</p>

<p class="quote2">
Theoretically, psychotherapy is never-ending, since emotional
growth can go on as long as one lives.
<br /><br />
  Lewis R. Wolberg,<br />
  <i>The Technique of Psychotherapy</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It can be difficult to know when to terminate therapy: difficult
for you, the client, and sometimes also difficult for the therapist.
Some periods in therapy do not lead to a successful outcome.
You may become dissatisfied with the process of therapy or with
the therapist.  Or, the therapist may become disappointed in your
willingness to work and to change.  An impasse may be reached
where it seems no progress can be made.  When this happens, it
can be hard to know when to draw a line, to say: "We've tried,
but we have to face the fact that we're not getting anywhere."  But
sometimes this has to be said, and then you may decide to
look elsewhere for help.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, when your therapy has been successful and
has led to clear, constructive results, it may also be difficult to
know when to stop.  To most clients, what tends to be most
important is <i>relief from symptoms</i>.  When this is achieved, you
may be tempted to terminate.  But relief from troubling
symptoms is not always a sign that problems have been resolved.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
Frequently, relief from distress comes about because of <i>problem
avoidance</i>.  You may have structured your life in a way that
circumvents, rather than faces, the things that trouble you.  There
are times when this is indeed the best solution.  However, the
tendency is for clients to associate relief with effective therapy,
and often this is not the case.
</p>

<p>
The therapist, on the other hand, may have certain personal
values that he wishes to satisfy before ending therapy with you:
he may favor, for example, qualities of assertiveness and
ambitiousness (or qualities of submissiveness and compliance), want
you to develop these traits, and feel reluctant to end therapy
until you have done this.
</p>

<p>
In general, the decision to terminate therapy should be made
with a number of objectives in mind:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Have your troubling symptoms disappeared or at least
been reduced to a level that is tolerable?
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Have you improved your understanding of yourself so that
you feel a healthy measure of self-acceptance?
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Do you now have a greater tolerance to frustration?
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Have you developed realistic life goals?
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Are you able to function relatively well in social groups?
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* Are you better able to enjoy life and work?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These goals need always to be <i>tempered</i>; they all involve
comparative judgments that should take into account where you
started and what you have accomplished.  There is no perfection
here, only degrees of adjustment, compromise, and a willingness
to accept yourself as a mixture of human weaknesses and
strengths.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
FACING RELAPSES
</p>

<p>
Some therapists believe that therapy cannot be called successful
until you have had a relapse and have been able to get
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
through it on your own.  Shadows of old habits linger on.  They
are especially likely to resurface during periods of insecurity,
disappointment, and frustration.  They represent a part of
you&mdash;perhaps a part you would just as soon were not there, but a part
of you, nonetheless, that you cannot expect to eradicate completely.
</p>

<p>
You are much better prepared to face the challenges of the
future, of events that cannot be anticipated, and of uncertainties
that cannot be avoided, if you do not demand a total change in
yourself to the point that old reactions never recur.  You are
better prepared if you realize that it is likely some will return for
brief visits during periods of particular stress.  If and when this
happens, you can render these visits less distressing and less able
to throw you by using the understanding you have gained from
therapy.
</p>

<p class="quote2">
You are apt to get a flurry of anxiety and a return of symptoms
from time to time.  Don't be upset or intimidated by this.  The
best way to handle yourself is first to realize that your relapse
is self-limited.  It will eventually come to a halt.  Nothing
terrible will happen to you.  Second, ask yourself what has been
going on.  Try to figure out what created your upset, what
aroused your tension.  Relate this to the general patterns that
you have been pursuing....  Old habits hold on, but they will
eventually get less and less provoking.[<a id="chap21fn2text"></a><a href="#chap21fn2">2</a>]

<p class="t3b">
HOW TO CARRY ON
</p>

<p>
Therapy is a temporary crutch or a cast in which to heal, a
comfort, a source for renewed faith in yourself, and an experience
of learning.  It cannot solve all the problems of future living,
for these pose new challenges that require of us all that we
readjust our goals and expectations, become more resilient and
less easily troubled or broken.  (The flexible bamboo is more
likely to survive a storm than the mighty oak.)
</p>

<p>
Reducing an individual's rigidity is an objective of all
psychotherapies.  Becoming less rigid allows you to accommodate to
changes and to tolerate external stress more easily.  Decreased
rigidity helps you adjust to new demands placed on you by your
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
</p>

<p>
But there is another side to living successfully, and that is, first,
the ability to recognize situations and circumstances that cause
you excessive stress and, second, the willingness to leave them
before it is too late.  We tend to place <i>all</i> of the responsibility for
adjustment to stress on ourselves, on our inner strengths.  But
often this is unnecessary, unreasonable, and even self-destructive.
Often it is the <i>situation</i> that is not desirable or tolerable,
not a "weakness" in ourselves in being unable to cope with it.  It
can sometimes take more strength and courage to break free
from a pattern of frustration and unhappiness than to remain on,
slowly wearing down your resources and growing older fast.
</p>

<p>
Much of successful living after therapy is a matter of
<i>prevention</i>: of being aware when you begin to tax yourself more
than you need to, when your body and mind begin to tell you
that you are developing new habits of anxiety or depression or
are starting to reinforce old ones.  At these times, take stock of
what you are doing, of how your daily living may be in conflict
with your values and attitudes.  Prevention here means being
willing to change an undesirable situation, not just enduring it
while trying to change its consequences <i>in you</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is largely a matter of knowing and respecting yourself, of
<i>not</i> requiring yourself to accept conditions that you feel will
lead you to grief.  Therapy may help you tolerate stress more
easily, but this is one-sided if you do not also learn to protect
yourself from stress that is excessive.  (Even bamboos can be
broken.)
</p>

<p>
Therapy is an opportunity for you to learn how to cope better
with the problems of living.  You learn that you can face the
demands of life successfully in these ways:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* through belief in yourself and through strength of will
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* by diminishing your preoccupation with yourself and
developing interests outside yourself
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* by understanding your reactions and accepting them
rather than fighting yourself
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* by living in the present
</p>

<p class="bullet">
* by taking yourself less seriously, by developing a sense of
humor and perspective
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
Having learned these things, you then simply do the best you
can within the limitations of life.
